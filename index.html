    <h2 id='I'>I. Introduction to the Course</h2>
    
    <p><b>.NET supports various types of applications:</b></p>
    <p><b>Desktop</b> Applications: These are traditional applications that run on Windows-based desktop 
      platforms. They provide a rich user interface and can be built using technologies like Windows Forms 
      (WinForms) or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).</p>
    <p>Applications for <b>macOS</b>: .NET supports the development of applications for 
      macOS using technologies like Xamarin.Mac and .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI). They allow building 
      native macOS applications using C# and .NET.</p>
    <p><b>Linux</b> .NET Core and .NET 5+ support the development of applications for Linux distributions 
      like Ubuntu. You can create console applications, web applications, or even desktop applications 
      targeting the Linux platform.</p>
    <p><b>WEB</b> .NET enables the development of web applications using technologies like ASP.NET, 
      ASP.NET Core, and Blazor. These applications run on web servers and can be accessed through web 
      browsers, providing dynamic and interactive experiences.</p>
         
    <p><b>Network Stack: Backend/Middleware/Frontend</b></p>
    
    <object class='obsvg' title='Network Stack' aria-hidden="true" data='img/image015.svg' type='image/svg+xml'></object>
    
    <p>The <b>WEB stack</b> is very complicated indeed, but if you look at it vertically, it might look 
      something like this: </p>
        
    <object class='obsvg' title='Vertical Stack' aria-hidden="true" data='img/image017.svg' type='image/svg+xml'></object>
    
    <p><b>iOS</b>: Xamarin also allows developing applications for iOS using C# and .NET. It enables code 
      sharing between iOS, Android, and other platforms.</p>
    <p><b>Android</b>: With Xamarin, you can create applications for Android using C# and .NET. Xamarin allows 
      code sharing between Android, iOS, and other platforms.</p>
    <p><b>Windows Phone</b>: Windows Phone development is supported through technologies like Windows Phone Silverlight 
      and Universal Windows Platform (UWP).</p>
    <p><b>Other platforms</b> .NET also has support for other platforms, including smart TVs, IoT devices, game consoles, 
      and more, through frameworks like .NET Core, Xamarin, and Mono.</p>
    
    <p><b>Net Applications and Tools</b></p>
    <p><b>GitHub Codespaces</b> a cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub. It allows developers 
      to create and manage fully-configured development environments in their browser. Codespaces provides a 
      seamless and collaborative coding experience, enabling developers to write, build, test, and debug code 
      directly from their web browser without the need for complex local setup. It integrates closely with GitHub 
      repositories, making it easy to clone, edit, and submit code directly within the Codespaces environment.</p>
    <p>GitHub Codespaces allows you to open GitHub projects directly in an online development environment. It 
      provides a cloud-based, browser-accessible development environment with pre-configured tools and ready-to-use 
      libraries. If you have a project on GitHub, in Codespaces, you can easily collaborate, develop, and test code 
      without the need to set up a local development environment or install software on your local machine. Codespaces 
      supports various programming languages and frameworks, allowing developers to work on different types of projects, 
      including desktop, web, mobile, and multi-platform applications. It offers integrated development software with 
      features like code editing, debugging, terminal access, and collaboration tools, making it a convenient tool for 
      individuals or teams and facilitating their work on projects from anywhere.</p>
    
    <p><b>Common Language Runtime (CLR)</b> </p>
    
    <p>The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the execution environment for .NET applications. It provides core services 
      such as memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection (recycling memory occupied by objects). The 
      CLR also compiles and executes .NET bytecode, known as Common Intermediate Language (CIL), into machine code at 
      runtime for more efficient execution. It offers a managed execution environment that ensures safety of the used 
      data types, security, and language interoperability, allowing different .NET languages to seamlessly work together. 
      Additionally, the CLR provides features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, automatic memory management, and robust 
      error handling, contributing to the reliability and performance of .NET applications.</p>
    
    <p><b>NuGet</b></p>
    
    <p>NuGet packages are modular units of code that can be easily shared and reused across different projects. They contain 
      libraries, frameworks, tools, and other components that enhance and streamline the development process. With NuGet packages, 
      developers can easily incorporate existing functionality into their applications, saving time and effort. These packages are 
      managed through the NuGet package manager, simplifying the management of project dependencies on specific packages and 
      controlling library versions.</p>
    
    <p><b>CLI - Command Line Interface</b></p>
    <p>When creating an application using .NET CLI, you start by opening the console or terminal, which serves as the 
      command-line interface. From there, you can use the <b>dotnet</b> command to create a new project, write code, 
      compile the application, and run it. The .NET CLI provides a streamlined workflow for building and managing .NET 
      applications. With the help of GitHub Codespaces, a development environment is provided that allows you to focus 
      on writing code while the platform takes care of the underlying infrastructure and build processes.</p>
    
    <p><b>Hold my beer</b></p>
      <p>Creating the <b>Hold my beer</b> application. The dotnet tools offer an easy way to create a "Hello World!" type 
      of application. Simply enter the following command to create a console application:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ <b>mkdir holdmybeer</b>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ <b>cd holdmybeer</b>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank/holdmybeer $ <b>dotnet new console</b>
</pre>

    <p>This command creates a new project - the <b>holdmybeer.csproj</b> file in the <b>holdmybeer</b> directory and adds 
      a source code file named <b>Program.cs</b>. The <b>dotnet new</b> command also includes the capability to restore 
      <b>dotnet</b> by automatically downloading and installing all the required <b>NuGet</b> packages from the GitHub 
      Codespaces server. To see a list of library dependencies and their versions used by the application, you can check 
      the project.assets.json file in the obj subdirectory. If the <b>--output</b> option (or <b>-o</b> for short) is not 
      used, the files are generated in the current directory.</p>
    
    <p><b>Creating a Web Application</b></p>


    <p>Similar to creating a console application, .NET CLI can be used to create a web application. When you enter 
    <b>dotnet new</b>, a list of available templates is displayed. The command <b>dotnet new webapp</b> creates a new web 
      application using ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages technologies. The project file created in this way includes the 
      Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web SDK. This SDK (Software Development Kit) contains tools and extensions necessary for creating 
      web applications and services.</p>    
    
<pre class='pre'>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank/holdmybeer $ <b>cd ..</b>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ <b>mkdir webapp</b>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ <b>cd webapp</b>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank/webapp $ <b>dotnet new webapp</b>
@404Joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank/webapp $ <b>dotnet run</b>

Result: Now listening on: http://localhost:5234
</pre>
    
    <p>The <b>Nginx</b> server of ASP.NET Core is automatically started and begins listening on port 5234 (or any other port in the 
      5xxx range). You can open a web browser and access the pages (by clicking the localhost link mentioned above) that this 
      server serves, as shown in the following figure.</p>
    
    <p><img src='img/image001.jpg' class='img' alt='Web App'></p>
    
    <p><b>Self-Contained Deployments</b></p>
    
    <p>Self-contained deployments refer to a deployment model where the application and all its dependencies are bundled 
      into a single package. This package includes the .NET runtime, libraries, and other resources required to run the 
      application on the end user's system. Self-contained deployments are platform-specific and independent of the target 
      machine's installed .NET. This approach ensures that the application can run on systems even without a pre-installed 
      .NET framework, making it easier to distribute and deploy .NET applications across different operating systems.</p>
      
<pre class='pre'>
$ dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64
$ dotnet publish -c Release -r osx.10.11-x64
$ dotnet publish -c Release -r ubuntu-x64
</pre>

    <p>After executing these commands, the necessary files for publishing can be found in the directories: 
      Release/[win10-x64|osx.10.11-x64|ubuntu-x64]/publish. </p>
      
    <p><b>Keywords in the C# language</b></p>
    <p>Keywords are reserved words in the language and cannot be used for any other purpose except as keywords. This means 
      that the names of classes, objects, methods, and variables must be different. The following is a list of keywords 
      in C#:</p>
      
    <p><b>abstract as base bool break byte case catch char checked class const continue
      decimal default delegate do double else enum event explicit extern false finally
      fixed float for foreach goto if implicit in int interface internal is lock
      long namespace new null object operator out override params private protected
      public readonly ref return sbyte sealed short sizeof stackalloc static string
      struct switch this throw true try typeof uint ulong unchecked unsafe ushort
      using virtual void volatile while</b></p>

    <h2 id='II'>II. Variables</h2>
    <p><b>Comment. </b></p>
    <p>In C#, the double forward slash (<b>//</b>) is used to indicate a single-line comment. Everything 
      written after <b>//</b> on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler. 
      Comments are used to add explanatory or descriptive text in the code, so that developers can better 
      understand the code. They are not executed as part of the program.</p>
    
    <p>Here are a few examples of single-line <b>comments:</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
// This is a comment

<span class='grn'>int</span> <span class='blu'>x</span> = <span class='red'>10</span>;      // Declaration of a variable named <span class='blu'>x</span> of type <span class='grn'>int</span>,
                 // initialized with a value of <span class='red'>10</span>
                 
<span class='grn'>int </span><b>sum </b>= <span class='blu'>x</span> + <span class='ora'>5</span>; // Calculation of the variable <b>sum</b>;
                 // the value of <b>sum</b> is: 15 /<span class='red'>10</span>+<span class='ora'>5</span>/
</pre>

    <p>Single-line comments are limited to a single line of code. If you need to add a comment that spans across multiple lines, 
    you can use <b>/*</b>multi-line comment<b>*/</b>:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
<b><span class='red'>/*</span></b> This is a multi-line comment.
   It can span across multiple lines.
   This and the above 2 lines are multi-line comments. <b><span class='red'>*/</span></b>

      7 digits of precision. Example: float pi = 3.14; float e = 2.73;</p>
    <p><b>double</b>: Represents a a fractional number with double-precision, 64 bits, with approximately 
      15-16 digits of precision.</p>
    <p><b>decimal</b>: Represents a decimal floating-point number with high precision and a wide range of values. 
      It is often used for financial and monetary calculations that require precise decimal representation.</p>
    <p><b>Character Types</b></p>
    <p><b>char</b>: Represents a single Unicode character: 'a', 'b', 'Ф', '☆', '7', '$', '#', '預', etc. It can be any character 
      available on the keyboard. For example: char ch = '№';</p>
    <p><b>string</b>: Represents a sequence of characters (<b>chars</b>) and is used for storing and manipulating 
      text in C#. For example: string s = "Hold my beer";</p>
    <p><b>Boolean Type</b></p>
    <p><b>bool</b>: Represents a logical Boolean value, which can be <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. It is commonly used for logical 
      operations and logical expressions in C#.</p>
    <p>These types represent different kinds of data for storage and manipulation, such as integers, 
      floating-point numbers, characters, and text.</p>
    
    <p><b>I've seen it, but it does not exsists: void</b></p>
    <p><b>void</b> - It is a type that indicates no specified type. Functions (more like procedures) declared 
      as <b>void</b> do not return a result/value with <b>return</b>.</p>
    <p><b>var</b> - The <b>var</b> keyword in C# is used to declare variables without specifying a specific type. 
      The compiler automatically determines the type based on the value assigned to the variable, and the type 
      cannot be changed afterward. For example, you cannot assign a number first and then store a string. 
      It must be initialized at the time of declaration: <b>var</b> myString <b>=</b> "Hold my beer";</p>

    <p><b>Variable Declaration</b></p>
    <p>A variable declaration consists of the following:</p>
    <p><b><span class='grn'>variable_type</span></b><b> <span class='red'>variable_name</span>;</b></p>
    <p><b><span class='grn'>variable_type</span></b><b> - </b>a valid C# type such as 
      <b>byte, int, float, double, decimal, char, string, bool, etc.</b>, or other types/classes valid for the project;</p>
    <p><b><span class='red'>variable_name</span></b><b> - </b>should not start with a digit, contain spaces, or be a 
      reserved keyword in the language;</p>
    <p>Variable declaration is similar to assigning in mathematics. Once you write "we assign <b>z = x</b>", 
      you can use <b>z</b> in the following lines.</p>
    <p><b>Variable Scope</b></p>
    <p>In C#, the scope of a local variable is determined by the block in which it is declared. A local 
      variable can only be accessed within the block where it is defined, including any nested blocks within 
      it. Once outside the block, the local variable goes out of scope and is no longer accessible. Here's an 
      example to illustrate the scope of a variable:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
void MyFunction()
<b><span class='blu'>{ // start of the block where 'x' is declared</span></b>
    int x = 10; // Local variable 'x' declared in the function
    if (x > 5)
    <b><span class='red'>{ // start of the block where 'y' is declared</span></b>
        int y = 20; // <b>Local variable 'y' declared in the if block</b>
        Console.WriteLine(x); // <b>Accessible: 'x' is in scope</b>
        Console.WriteLine(y); // <b>Accessible: 'y' is in scope</b>
    <b><span class='red'>} // end of the block where 'y' is declared</span></b>
    Console.WriteLine(x); // <b>Accessible: 'x' is in scope</b>
    Console.WriteLine(y); // <b><span class='lil'>ERROR</span>: 'y' is out of scope</b>
<b><span class='blu'>} // end of the block where 'x' is declared</span></b>
</pre>

    <p>In the example provided, variable <b>x</b> is accessible throughout the entire function because it is declared in the 
      outer block. However, variable <b>y</b> is only accessible within the <b><span class='red'>{</span></b> and 
      <b><span class='red'>}</span></b> block of the if statement because it is declared inside it. Once you exit the if block, 
      the variable <b>y</b> goes out of scope and is no longer accessible.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that variables with the same name can be declared in different blocks, and they will have 
      separate scopes. Each block creates a new scope for the variables declared within it.</p>

    <p>Local variables with the same name cannot be declared twice within the same scope. For example, you cannot do this:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int x = 20;

// ... source code ... ;
 
x = 30; // OK, x is assigned 30 

<span class='red'>int</span> x = 30; // Not OK, because int is used, which means we're declaring x again
</pre>

    <p>Here's another example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int p = 20;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) 
{
    int i = 50; // NOT allowed — i is still in scope
    int p = 40; // NOT allowed — p is still in scope
    p = 30;     // This is allowed — we're changing the value of the variable p from 20 to 30
    Console.WriteLine(p + i);
}
</pre>

    <p>In this example, within the for loop, the variable <b>x</b> is declared in each iteration, but it does not 
      conflict with the loop variable <b>i</b> because they have separate scopes. However, attempting to declare 
      a new variable <b>p</b> within the loop would cause a conflict because it is already declared in the outer scope.</p>

    <p>If you try to compile this, you will receive an error message like the following:</p>
    <p><b>error CS0136</b>: A local variable named 'i' cannot be declared in this scope
      because it would give a different meaning to 'i', which is already used in a
      'closer' scope to define a local or parameter</p>
    <p>This happens because the variable <b>i</b>, which is defined before the start of
      the for loop, is still in the scope of the for loop and will not go out of scope
      until the for loop finishes execution. The compiler cannot differentiate between
      these two variables, so it does not allow the second one to be declared.</p>
    <p><b>Constants</b></p>
    <p>In C#, a constant is a value that cannot be changed during program execution. It is
      declared using the <b>const</b> keyword and must be assigned a value at the time of
      declaration. Here are some key points regarding constants:</p>
    <p>• Declaration of a constant: Constants are declared using the <b>const</b> keyword,
      followed by the data type and the name of the constant. For example: <b>const int
      MAX_VALUE = 100;</b>.</p>
    <p>• Value assignment: Constants must be assigned a value at the time of declaration,
      and this value cannot be changed later in the program. For example, <b>const double
      PI = 3.14159;</b></p>
    <p>• Data types: Constants can be declared with any valid C# data type, including numeric
      types, strings, characters, boolean values, etc.</p>
    <p>• Naming convention: By convention, constant names are usually written in uppercase
      with words separated by underscores. For example, <b>const int MAX_COUNT = 10;</b></p>
    <p><b>Usage</b>: Constants are useful when you have a value that needs to remain the same
      throughout the program and should not be changed accidentally. They can provide
      meaningful names to important values and improve code readability.</p>
    <p><b>Scope</b>: Constants have block scope, which means they are only accessible within
      the code block in which they are defined.</p>
    <p>Compile-time constants vs. read-only: Constants differ from read-only variables in
      that the values of read-only variables can be assigned at runtime, while constants
      are replaced with their values at compile-time.</p>
    <p><b>Here's an example demonstrating the use of constants:</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
class Program
{
    
    <b>const </b>double PI = 3.14159;
    <b>const </b>int MAX_VALUE = 100;
    
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The value of PI is: {<b>PI</b>}");
        Console.WriteLine($"The maximum value is: {<b>MAX_VALUE</b>}");
    }
    
}

// Result:
// The value of PI is: 3.14159
// The maximum value is: 100
</pre>

    <p>In the above example, the constants <b>PI</b> and <b>MAX_VALUE</b> are declared and used
      within the <b>Main</b> method. Once assigned, their values cannot be changed during
      program execution. Constants are useful for providing meaningful names to important
      values, improving code readability, and ensuring that specific values remain constant
      throughout the program.</p>
      
    <p><b>Note</b>: The line Console.WriteLine(<b>$</b>"You entered: <b>{a}</b>");
      is called string interpolation. The <b>$</b> sign before "You entered: {a}" means 
      that the content within the <b>{</b>braces<b>}</b> in the string will be replaced with the value of the 
      variable, i.e., <b>{a}</b> will be replaced with the value of the variable named <b>a</b>.</p>  
      
    <p><b>The null Constant</b></p>
    <p>In C#, the null constant is represented by the keyword <b>null</b>. It is used to indicate
      the absence of a value or that a variable of an object type does not reference an object.
      Here are a few key points regarding the null constant:</p>
    <p>• <b>null</b> is not a valid value for value types (such as int, bool, etc.), but it can be
      assigned to any variable of a reference/object type.</p>
    <p>• When a variable is assigned the value <b>null</b>, it means that it does <b>not</b> reference
      an object in memory.</p>
    <p><b>null</b> can be used for various purposes, such as initializing variables, indicating an
      uninitialized state, or checking for null conditions before accessing object members or
      invoking object methods.</p>
      
    <p><b>null Forgiving Operator</b></p>
    <p>The <b><span class='red'>!</span></b> operator is called the <b>null-forgiving</b> operator. It is
      used to suppress compiler warnings for null references. Here are some important details:</p>
    <p>• The null-forgiving operator tells the compiler to assume that an expression or variable
      will never be null, even if static analysis suggests otherwise.</p>
    <p>• It is denoted by placing <b><span class='red'>!</span></b> after the expression or variable,
      like: <b>myVariable!</b></p>
    <p>Using the null-forgiving operator can be useful when you are certain that a given value
      will never be null. However, be cautious as it removes null safety checks at compile
      time. If the value actually turns out to be null during runtime, a <b>NullReferenceException</b>
      will be thrown.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the null-forgiving operator should be used judiciously and
      only when you are absolutely certain that no null values will occur. In general, it is
      better to ensure proper null checking and handling to avoid potential runtime exceptions.</p>
    
    <p><b>Assignment operator (<span class='red'>= ➜ read this as 'assigns'</span></b><span class='red'>!!!</span><b>)</b></p>
    <p>When declaring a variable, you can assign it an initial value:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int a <b><span class='red'>=</span></b> 10;  // <b><span class='red'>=</span></b> ➜ <b>the assignment operator; read as 'a assigns ten'</b>
char ch = '№';
float pi = 3.14;
</pre>

    <p>The <b><span class='red'>=</span></b> sign is called <span class='red'>assignment</span> and
      it means that the value of variable <b>a</b> is set to the number <b>10</b>.</p>
    <p>If the initial value of a variable is not assigned, it is set to a random number (or a
      random character if the variable is of type char).</p>
    <p>It is possible to assign a value to a variable separately from its declaration:</p>
      
<pre class='pre'>
float euler; 
euler = 2.71;
</pre>

    <p><b>Numeric Variable Operations</b></p>
    <p>In other cases, the variable directly assigns a value that is the sum or product
      of values or variables, for example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int a, b = 10;
a = 20 + b;
</pre>

    <p>After performing the above operation, the value in variable <b>a</b> is <b>30</b>.</p>
    <p>The following <b>Arithmetic Operators</b> are allowed in the C# language:</p>
    <p>• <b>+</b> ➜ Addition</p>
    <p>• <b>-</b> ➜ Subtraction</p>
    <p>• <b>*</b> ➜ Multiplication</p>
    <p>• <b>/</b> ➜ Division</p>
    <p>• <b>%</b> ➜ Remainder (only for the <b>int</b>/<b>byte</b> data type)</p>
    <p>The mentioned operations are binary, meaning they require two operands: left and right. The remainder
      operation is applied only to integer types.</p>
    <p><b>String Operations</b></p>
    <p>Concatenation of 2 strings ➜ operator <b><span class='red'>+</span></b>:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
string str1 = "Hold";
string str2 = "my beer";
string result = str1 <b><span class='red'>+</span></b> " " <b><span class='red'>+</span></b> str2; // " " - space character
Console.WriteLine(result); 

// Result: 
// <b>Hold my beer</b>
</pre>
    <p><b>Is String1 equal to String2 ?</b></p>
<pre class='pre'>
string str1 = "Hold my";
string str2 = "Beer";

if (str1 == str2)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The strings are equal.");
}
else 
{   
    // else is executed, because "Hold my" <b>is different from</b> "Beer"
    Console.WriteLine("The strings are <b>not</b> equal.");
}

// Result:
// The strings are not equal.
</pre>

    <p>In the above example, the <b>== <span class='red'>(!!! == is called equals !!!)</span></b> operator is used to compare 
      str1 and str2. If the strings are equal, it will print "The strings are equal". Otherwise, it will print "The strings 
      are not equal".</p>
    <p>Note that the == operator compares the content of the strings, meaning</p>
    <p>"Hold" == "hold" ➜ yields false because "<b>H</b>old" starts with an uppercase letter, while "<b>h</b>old" does not.</p>
    <p>If you want to perform a comparison regardless of whether the letters are uppercase or lowercase, you can use the 
    <b>String.Equals</b> method with the appropriate parameters, like this:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
string str1 = "Hold";
string str2 = "hold";

if (string.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) 
{   
    // <b>this block executes</b>
    // Unlike the previous example, now "Hold" == "hold"
    // because the letter case is ignored.
    Console.WriteLine("The strings are equal. (Case-insensitive)");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The strings are not equal. (Case-insensitive).");
}

// Result:
// The strings are equal. (Case-insensitive)
</pre>

    <p>In the last example, the <b>string.Equals</b> method is used with the <b>StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase</b> 
      parameter to compare <b>str1</b> to <b>str2</b> in case-insensitive manner /regardless of the letter case/.</p>
    
    <p><b>Useful methods</b> of the string object for working with character strings:</p>
    <p>str1.<b>StartsWith</b>: Checks if the string starts with a specific substring.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>EndsWith</b>: Checks if the string ends with a specific substring.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>Contains</b>: Determines if the substring is present in the string.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>IndexOf</b>: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specific substring.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>LastIndexOf</b>: Returns the index of the last occurrence of a specific substring.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>Substring</b>: Extracts a substring based on the specified starting index and optional length.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>Replace</b>: Replaces all occurrences of a specific substring with another substring.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>ToUpper</b>: Converts the string to uppercase.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>ToLower</b>: Converts the string to lowercase.</p>
    <p>str1.<b>Trim</b>: Removes the leading and trailing whitespace from the string.</p>

    <h2 id='III'>III. Control Statements: if × for </h2>
    <p><b>CONTROL FLOW DURING PROGRAM EXECUTION</b></p>
    <p>This section discusses the expressions that allow you to control the flow of execution in your program. With conditional 
    control statements - expressions like the <b>if</b> and <b>switch</b> statements, you can branch your code depending on 
    whether certain conditions are met. You can repeat expressions using loop statements like for, while, and foreach.</p>
    
    <p><b>Logical Expressions</b></p>
    <p>Logical expressions are composed of variables or values connected by logical operators. In computer science, logical 
      expressions yield one of two possible values: <b>true</b> (in C language, typically represented by a non-zero value) or 
      <b>false</b> (in C language, typically represented by the value zero). Binary logical operators operate on two values, 
      while the unary operator (specifically the not operator) operates on a single value. <b>The logical operators</b> 
      are as follows:

    <p><b>! (NOT)</b> operator: It inverts the logical value of an expression. If we have an expression that is true, 
      then ! makes it false; if the expression is false, then ! makes it true.</p>
    <p>bool a = true;</p>
    <p>bool b = !a; // b == false;</p>
    
    <p><b>&amp;&amp; (AND)</b> operator: It performs a logical AND operation between two expressions. It returns <b>true</b> if 
      both expressions are <b>true</b>, and <b>false</b> otherwise.
    
    <p><b>|| (OR)</b> operator: It performs a logical OR operation between two expressions. It returns <b>true</b> if at least 
      one of the expressions is <b>true</b>, and <b>false</b> if both expressions are false.
    
    <p><b>^ (XOR)</b> It performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two expressions. It returns <b>true</b> if the 
      expressions have different logical values (one is <b>true</b> and the other is <b>false</b>), and false if the expressions have 
      the same logical value (both <b>true</b> or both <b>false</b>)
    
    <p>Logical operators for <b>comparison</b></p>
    
    <p>When constructing logical expressions that involve comparing values or values of variables of numeric types, relational 
      operators are used in the C language. The result of executing these operators is also <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>: </p>      
    <p><b>a == b</b> returns <b>true</b>, if <b>a</b> is <b>Equal</b> to <b>b</b></p>
    <p><b>a != b</b> returns <b>true</b>, if <b>a</b> is <b>Not Equal</b> to <b>b</b></p>
    <p><b>a &gt; b</b> returns<b>true</b>, if <b>a</b> is <b>Greater</b> then <b>b</b></p>
    <p><b>a &lt; b</b> returns <b>true</b>, if <b>a</b> Is <b>Less</b> then <b>b</b></p>
    <p><b>a &gt;= b</b> returns <b>true</b> if <b>a</b> Is <b>Greater</b> then or <b>Equal</b> to <b>b</b></p> 
      <p><b>a &lt;= b</b> returns <b>true</b>, if <b>a</b> is <b>Less</b> then or <b>Equal</b> to <b>b</b></p>
    
    <p>The <b>if</b> Statement</p>
    <p>The <b>if</b> statement allows you to execute a conditional block of code if a given logical expression is has value <b>true</b>.
    
<pre class='pre'>
if (<span class='grn'>logical_expression</span>) 
<b><span class='red'>{</span></b> 
    this block executes, only if <span class='grn'>logical_expression</span> is evaluated to <b>true</b> 
<b><span class='red'>}</span></b>
</pre>    

    <p>For example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int a = -120; // <b>-</b>120 &lt;= negative number 

if (a &gt; 0)
{
    // The code is executed if <b>a</b> is positive, in this case it is not executed
    // because <b>a == -120</b>.
    // <span class='grn'>logical_expression:</span> <b>a &gt; 0</b> ➜ -120 &gt; 0 ➜ <b>false</b>
}
</pre>    
    
    <p>The <b>if-else:</b> Statement</p>
    <p>The <b>if/else</b> statement extends the 'if' statement by providing an alternative code block for execution if 
      the condition is false /with a value of <b>false</b>/. It allows you to control two different cases. For example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
a = -120; // -120 &lt;= negative number 

if (a &gt; 0)
<b>{</b>
    // This block of code is not executed because a == -120,
    // <span class='grn'>logical_expression:</span> <b>a &gt; 0</b> ➜ -120 &gt; 0 ➜ <b>false</b>
<b>}</b>
<b>else</b>
<b>{</b>
    // This block of code is executed only when a &gt; 0 is false 
    // <span class='grn'>logical_expression:</span> a &gt; 0 ➜ -120 &gt; 0 ➜ false
    // Therefore, it will be executed because <b>a &gt; 0</b> is not true,
    // i.e., when <b>a &lt; 0</b> or <b>a</b> == 0
<b>}</b>
</pre>    

    <p><b>if / else if / ... / else if / else</b> statement: This statement allows you to handle multiple 
      <span class='grn'>logical_expressions</span> sequentially. Each logical expression is evaluated one 
      by one, and the corresponding code block is executed for the first <span class='grn'>logical_expression</span>
      that evaluates to true. If none of the logical expressions in the if statements are satisfied 
      (<span class='grn'>logical_expressions == </span><b>false</b>), the <b>else</b> block is executed as 
      a fallback option. For example:</p>
     
<pre class='pre'>
int a = -120;

if (<span class='grn'>a &gt; 0</span>) 
<span class='grn'>{</span>
    // <span class='grn'>{</span>if block <b>№1</b> <span class='grn'>}</span>
    // Not executed because a == -120; <span class='grn'>a &gt; 0 </span>➜ <span class='grn'>-120 &gt; 0</span> ➜ <b>false</b>
    Console.WriteLine("a is a positive number");
<b><span class='grn'>}</span></b> 
else if (<span class='blu'>a == 0</span> ) 
<b><span class='blu'>{</span></b> 
    // <span class='blu'>{</span>if block <b>№2<span class='blu'>}</span></b>
    // Not executed because a == -120; <span class='blu'>a == 0</span> ➜ <span class='blu'>-120 == 0</span> ➜ <b>false</b>
    Console.WriteLine("a is zero");
<b><span class='blu'>}</span></b> 
else 
<span class='red'>{</span> 
    // <span class='red'>{</span>else block<b><span class='red'>}</span></b>
    // Executed because a == -120; and neither <span class='grn'>a &gt; 0</span> nor <span class='grn'>a == 0</span> are satisfied
    // therefore, no need to check for  a &lt; 0 since if it's not zero 
    // and is not positive, it remains only to be negative
    Console.WriteLine("a is a negative number");
<b><span class='red'>}</span></b>

// Result:
// a is a negative number
</pre>

    <p><b>Important:</b> In the constructs:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
<b>if(...) 
<span class='blu'>{</span> 
    action1;
    action2; 
<span class='blu'>}</span></b>
</pre>    
      
    <p>the curly braces <b><span class='blu'>{}</span></b> can be omitted, but only when there is only one action inside 
    them like: { action1; } &lt;- only one <b>;</b> in {}. In that case, the notation becomes: 
      
<pre class='pre'>      
if(...) 
    action1;
</pre>
    
    <p><b>Shortened Conditional Operator /Ternary Operator/</b></p>
    <p>The ternary conditional operator, to some extent, replaces the if statement and is convenient in certain 
    cases, such as when checking variable values:</p>
    
    <p>Variable = (<span class='grn'>logical_expression</span>) ? value to be returned if <span class='grn'>logical_expression</span> 
      is true <b>:</b> value to be returned if <span class='grn'>logical_expression</span> is false;</p>

    <p>Example:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
int a;

a = 5 &gt; 3 ? 10 : 20; // a == 10
</pre>

    <p>The value of <b>a </b> after executing the above line is <b>10</b> because 5 is always greater than 3 (<b>true</b>), 
    so the first value (10) is returned. In the alternative case:  
      
<pre class='pre'>
int a; 

a = 5 &lt; 3 ? 10 : 20; // a == 20
</pre>

    <p>The value of <b>a</b> becomes <b>20</b>. The numbers in the above two examples can be replaced with variables.</p>
    
    <p><b>Switch Statement</b></p>

    <p>Similar to the if statement, the switch statement is used to select one of several possible options. Its syntax can be 
    demonstrated with the following example: Write a program where an integer within the range [1, 7] is entered, and the 
    program outputs the corresponding day of the week.</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int day = 3; 

switch ( day ) 
{        
    case  1 : System.Console.WriteLine("Monday");    break; 
    case  2 : System.Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");   break;    
    case  3 : System.Console.WriteLine("Wednesday"); break;
    case  4 : System.Console.WriteLine("Thursday");  break;
    case  5 : System.Console.WriteLine("Friday");    break;
    case  6 : System.Console.WriteLine("Saturday");  break;
    case  7 : System.Console.WriteLine("Sunday");    break;
    default : System.Console.WriteLine("The number is not in the range [1, 7]"); break;
}  

// Result: 
// <b>Wednesday</b> // because the <b>day</b> variable equals 3 
</pre>

    <p><b>switch</b> is a keyword, and the variable inside the parentheses can be of type <b>char</b> (or <b>int</b> - integer).</p>
    
    <p>Its execution proceeds as follows: Sequentially, it checks whether the value of the variable (inside the parentheses) 
    matches the values of the constants (or variables) following the <b>case</b> clauses. In case of a match, the corresponding 
    sequence of instructions is executed (in this case, printing the respective day of the week). The <b>break</b> command causes 
    the execution of the <b>switch</b> statement to be interrupted, and execution continues after the closing curly brace <b>}</b> of 
    the <b>switch</b> statement. The "default" clause is not mandatory. If it exists, it is executed only if the value of the 
    expression does not match any of the enumerated <b>case</b> values (or variables).</p>
    
    <p>A program in which a number (from 1 to 12) representing a month is entered, and the program shows which season it belongs to:</p>
      
<pre class='pre'>
int month = 5;

switch(month) 
{       
    case 12 : case  1 : case  2 : Console.WriteLine(" Winter "); break;
    case  3 : case  4 : case  5 : Console.WriteLine(" Spring "); break;    
    case  6 : case  7 : case  8 : Console.WriteLine(" Summer "); break;
    case  9 : case 10 : case 11 : Console.WriteLine(" Autumn "); break;
    default : Console.WriteLine&lt;&lt;"The entered month is not within the range [1, 12] "; break;
}  

// Result: 
// Spring
</pre>

    <p>The construction</p>
    <p>case 3: case 4: case 5: Console.WriteLine("Spring"); break;</p>
    <p>is interpreted by the computer as: If the variable "month" is 3, or 4, or 5, then print <b>Spring</b></p> 

    <p>The <b>for</b> loop</p>
    <p>C# provides four different loop statements (<b>for, while, do-while</b>, and <b>foreach</b>) that allow you to execute 
    a block of code repeatedly until a given logical_expression evaluates to <b>false</b>. With the <b>for</b> keyword, you 
    iterate through the loop by testing a certain logical_expression to be <b>true</b> before performing another iteration.</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
for (<span class='red'>int i = 0;</span> <span class='blu'>i &lt; 100;</span><span class='grn'> i++</span>) 
<b><span class='lil'>{</span></b>
    Console.Write(i + " # "); // This line is repeated 100 times, at the first execution
                              // i == 0 /initial value/; at the second execution i == 1; ...
                              // in the last execution i == 99,
                              // and after the <span class='grn'>i++</span> ➜ i == 100, the logical 
                              // expression becomes 100 &lt; 100 ➜ false ➜
                              // the execution stops.                              
<b><span class='lil'>}</span></b>

// Result: 
// 0 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 # 6 # 7 # 8 # 9 # 10 # 11 # 12 # 13 # 14 # 15 # 16 # 17 # 
// 18 # 19 # 20 # 21 # 22 # 23 # 24 # 25 # 26 # 27 # 28 # 29 # 30 # 31 # 32 # 33 # 
// 34 # 35 # 36 # 37 # 38 # 39 # 40 # 41 # 42 # 43 # 44 # 45 # 46 # 47 # 48 # 49 # 
// 50 # 51 # 52 # 53 # 54 # 55 # 56 # 57 # 58 # 59 # 60 # 61 # 62 # 63 # 64 # 65 # 
// 66 # 67 # 68 # 69 # 70 # 71 # 72 # 73 # 74 # 75 # 76 # 77 # 78 # 79 # 80 # 81 # 
// 82 # 83 # 84 # 85 # 86 # 87 # 88 # 89 # 90 # 91 # 92 # 93 # 94 # 95 # 96 # 97 # 
// 98 # 99 #
</pre>

    <p>The first expression in the <b>for</b> loop is the <span class='red'>initializer</span>.
      It is evaluated before the first execution. Usually, a local variable is initialized as a counter. </p>
      
    <p>The second expression is the <span class='blu'>logical_expression_for_termination</span>. It is checked before each 
      execution of the <b>for</b> block. If this expression evaluates to <b>true</b>, the block is executed. If it evaluates 
      to <b>false</b>, the <b>for</b> loop terminates, and the program continues with the next statement after the closing curly 
      brace <span class='lil'>}</span> of the <b>for</b> block ➜ after the closing bracket <span class='lil'>}</span>.</p>
      
    <p>Once the block is executed, <span class='grn'>the third expression</span>, the iterator, is executed. Typically, you 
      increment the counter of the loop. 
      Using <b>i++</b> adds the number <b>1</b> to the variable <b>i</b>. 
      <b>i++ &#x27F7; i = i + 1 &#x27F7; i += 1; </b>Similarly, <b>i += 10</b> increases <b>i</b> by <b>10</b>. After the third expression, the
      <span class='blu'>logical_expression_for_termination</span> is evaluated again to determine if a new execution of the 
      <b>for</b> block should be performed.</p>
            
    <p>The <b>for</b> loop is a precondition loop because the <span class='blu'>logical_expression_for_termination</span> is evaluated 
    before the execution. Therefore, the  <b><span class='lil'>{</span></b>content<b><span class='lil'>}</span></b> of the / for () <b><span class='lil'>{</span></b> ... content ... <b><span class='lil'>}</span></b> / will not be executed at all if the logical expression has a 
    <b>false</b> value. false.</p>
      
    <p><b>for</b>  loops can be nested, so the inner loop is executed completely once for each iteration of the outer loop. 
      This approach is commonly used for traversing each element in a rectangular two-dimensional array. The outer <b>for</b> 
      loop iterates through each row, and the inner <b>for</b> loop iterates through each column within the specified row. 
      The following code displays rows of numbers. It also uses another method of the console, <b>Console.Write</b>, which 
      does the same as <b>Console.WriteLine</b> but does not return the cursor to the beginning of the line:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
for (int p = 0; p &lt; 10; p++) 
{
    for (int q = 0; q &lt; 10; q++) 
    {
        int num = (p * 10) + q;
        Console.Write($"{num:D2} "); // :D2 - Prints the number with  
                                     // leading zeros if necessary.
        
        // Delaying execution by 
        // 0.2 seconds - 200 milliseconds,
        // to create something like animation.
        Thread.Sleep(200);                             
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}
</pre>

    <p><b>After approximately 20 seconds / 0.2 sec. × 10 × 10 ➜ 20 sec. / This will result in the following:</b></p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09

</pre>   
 
    <p>Each number is displayed with two digits / specifier <b>:D2</b> /, which ensures that numbers below 10 have a leading zero.</p>
    <p><b>Console.Write</b> and <b>Console.WriteLine</b></p> <p>The difference between <b>Console.Write</b> and <b>Console.WriteLine</b> 
    is as follows:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
Console.Write('a');
Console.Write('a');
Console.Write('a'); 

// Result:
// aaa   
</pre>
    
    <p>With WriteLine:</p>
    <p></p>
<pre class='pre'>
Console.WriteLine('a');
Console.WriteLine('a');
Console.WriteLine('a');

// Result:
// a
// a
// a
</pre>
          
    <p>- In other words, <b>Console.WriteLine('a');</b> adds a new line character / "\r\n" / after 'a', while 
      <b>Console.Write('a');</b> does not add it.</p>
    
    <p><b>The while loop</b></p>
    <p>Similar to the <b>for loop</b>, the <b>while loop</b> is a precondition loop. The syntax is similar:</p>
    
    
    
<pre class='pre'>
<span class='red'>int i = 0;</span>

while (<span class='blu'>i&lt;100</span>) 
{
   // ... instructions ...
   <span class='grn'>i++;</span>
}
</pre>

    <p>Unlike the <b>for</b> loop, the <b>while</b> loop is most commonly used to repeat an operator or a block of 
      operators/commands for a certain number of times that are not known before the start of the loop.</p>

     <p>The <b>do-while</b> loop is a post-condition loop. This means that the termination 
      <span class='blu'>logical_expression_for_termination</span> of the loop is evaluated after 
      the <b><span class='lil'>{</span></b> block <b><span class='lil'>}</span></b> of the loop has been executed. 
      Therefore, <b>do-while</b> loops are useful in situations where a block of expressions needs to be 
      executed <b>at least once</b>, as in this example:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
<span class='red'>int state = 1000;</span>

do 
{   
    // This loop will execute at least once, even if the logical expression has a false value.
    // This will be executed once:
    <span class='grn'>state ++; // </span>state == 1001
} while (<span class='blu'>state&lt;100</span>); // 1001 &lt; 100 ➜ <b>false ➜ </b>
                     // Execution continues from the next line
                     
Console.WriteLine($"state is: {state}");

// Result: 
// state is: 1001                     
</pre>
      
    <p>The <b>foreach</b> loop</p>
    <p>In the following code, assuming that <b>intArray</b> is an array of type <b>int</b>:</p>

    

<pre class='pre'>
foreach (int variabl in <b>intArray</b>) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(variabl);
}
</pre>

    <p><b>Break</b> and <b>continue</b> statements</p>
    <p>An example illustrating the use of <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> statements in an iterative loop is presented in the 
    following problem: Create a program that takes an input number and outputs it to the screen until the number 0 is entered:</p>


<pre class='pre'>
int a;        

do 
{
    Console.WriteLine(" Enter a number; enter 0 to exit");
    a = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    if ( a == 0 ) 
    {
        break; // The <b>while</b> loop breaks the <b>do</b> loop if 0 is entered for <b>a</b>.
    }
    Console.WriteLine($"You entered: {a}");
} while ( true ); // a logical expression always having the value <b>true</b>.

// Result:
// Enter a number; enter 0 to exit
// 5
// You entered: 5
// Enter a number; enter 0 to exit
// 6
// You entered: 6
// Enter a number; enter 0 to exit
// 0
</pre>    
    
    <p>The solution to the problem can also be implemented using the <b>continue</b> statement to skip to the next iteration.</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int a;

while ( true ) // <span class='red'>{</span> while block, repeats indefinitely <span class='red'>}</span>
<b><span class='red'>{ </span></b>
              
    <span class='blu'>Console.WriteLine("Enter a number; enter 0 to exit");</span>
    a = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    <span class='grn'>if ( a != 0 )</span> <span class='grn'>{ </span>// if the input for <b>a</b> is <b>0</b> 
                    // the actions within the <span class='grn'>{ ... }</span> braces are not performed
        Console.WriteLine($"You entered: {a}");
        
        <b>continue</b>; //  Move to the next execution of the <b>while</b> loop
                  //  i.e., <span class='blu'>Console.WriteLine("Enter...</span>
    <span class='grn'>}</span>
    
    <b>break</b>; // Move to the next execution if a == 0, because <span class='grn'>if ( a != 0 )</span> is not executed, 
           // therefore, <b>continue</b> is not executed.
<b><span class='red'>}</span></b>

// Result:
Enter a number; enter 0 to exit
5
You entered: 5
Enter a number; enter 0 to exit
6
You entered: 6
Enter a number; enter 0 to exit
0

    <p><b>Bitwise Operators</b></p>
    <p>Here's a brief summary of the bitwise operators in C#:</p>
    
    <p><b>bit</b> - a unit of information with a value of <b>1 /true/</b> or <b>0 /false/</b></p>
    <p><b>&lt;&lt;</b> (left shift): Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. 
      The number 4 in binary is 00000100. 00000100 &lt;&lt; 2 will result in 00010000. 00010000 <b>=</b> 16 (decimal). 
      <b>&lt;&lt;</b> is very useful for multiplication by 2 (or finding powers of 2) because every time a binary 
      number is shifted left by 1 position, its numerical value doubles.</p>
    <p>For example, 4 &lt;&lt; 3 = 32, because 4 &lt;&lt; 3 &#x27F7; 8 &lt;&lt; 2 &#x27F7; 16 &lt;&lt; 1 = 32;</p>
    <p>Equivalent to 4 × (2^3) = 32;</p>
    
    <p><b>&gt;&gt;</b> (right shift): Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. Each 
      right shift divides the number by 2. For example:</p> <p>00100000 (32 in decimal) &gt;&gt; 2 = 00001000 (8 in decimal), 
      or:</p> 
    <p>32 &gt;&gt; 2 = 16 &gt;&gt; 1 = 8.</p>
    <p><b>|</b> (bitwise OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation on two numbers, setting each resulting bit to 1 if at least one 
      of the corresponding  bits is 1.</p>
    <p><b>&amp;</b> (bitwise AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation on two numbers, setting each resulting bit to 1 only if 
      both corresponding bits are 1.</p>
    <p><b>^</b> (bitwise XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on two numbers, setting each resulting bit 
      to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.</p>

    <p>These operators work on individual bits of binary representations of numbers and are often used for low-level bitwise 
      manipulation or specific scenarios requiring bitwise operations.</p>
    <p>Regarding the bitwise operators <b>OR</b>, <b>XOR</b>, <b>AND</b> - they can be used to set individual bits or read 
      individual bits. Bits are numbered from right to left, with the rightmost bit at position 0. Example: 
      Position <span class='red'>0</span>: 0000010<span class='red'>0</span>; Position <span class='red'>4</span>: 
      000<span class='red'>0</span>0100; Position <span class='red'>7</span>: 0<span class='red'>0000100</span>. Below are 
      examples of their usage:</p>
      
    <p><b>Problem 1</b>: Number: 00000<span class='red'>1</span>00. Read bit 2 - If it's set to 1, return true; false 
      otherwise? <b>Solution:</b> To read the value of bit 2 in the number 00000<span class='red'>1</span>00, we shift the 
      position of the number 2 to the right using the >> operator and perform a bitwise <b>AND</b> with 0000000<span class='red'>1</span> 
      (decimal 1, also known as a <b>mask</b>). If the result is 1, the bit is set to 1; if the result is 0, the bit is not set, 
      and the result is false:</p>
    <p>The variable <b>isBitTrue</b> will be true because the bit at position 2 in the number 00000100 is 1.</p>
    <p><b>Problem 2</b>: Number: 00000<span class='red'>1</span>00. Set bit <span class='red'>2</span> to <span class='red'>0</span>. 
      <b>Solution:</b></p>
    <p>To unset (set to 0) bit 2 in the number 00000<span class='red'>1</span>00, we can use the bitwise <b>AND</b> operator (&amp;) 
      with a bitmask that has 0 in bit 2 and 1 everywhere else /11111<span class='red'>0</span>11/.</p>

    <p>The value of <b>result</b> will be 0b00000<span class='red'>0</span>00, which means that the bit at position 2 is 
      cleared (set to 0).</p>
    <p><b>Problem 3</b>: Number: 000<span class='red'>0</span>0100. Set bit <span class='red'>4</span> to <span class='red'>1</span>. 
    <b>Solution:</b></p>
      
      
    <p>To set (set to 1) bit 4 in the number 000<span class='red'>0</span>0100, we can use the bitwise <b>OR</b> operator (|) with 
      a bitmask that has 1 in bit 4 and 0 everywhere else.</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int number = 0b00000100;

int bitMask = 1 &lt;&lt; 4;
int result = number | bitMask;
</pre>

    <p>The value of <b>result</b> will be 0b000<span class='red'>1</span>0100, which means that the bit at position 4 is set to 1.</p>
    

    <p><b>Functions</b></p>
    <p>A function in programming is a piece of code that performs a certain activity and returns a result, for example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int add(int a, int b) 
{
    return a+b; // Returning the Result /sum
                // of <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> from the code's execution
}
</pre>
    
    <p>The function is called by its name, for example: add(10, 15) -&gt; The result 25 as a number is placed where 
      the function is called; it can be invoked in the following way:
    </p>
    <p>int c = add(15, add(10, 10)); // The variable <b>c</b> is assigned the value <b>35</b>.</p>
    <p>In C#, they are called <b>methods</b>, but they are essentially a kind of functions.</p>
    <p>Main Function - The <b>Main</b> function is an entry point for every program; the program's execution starts from it. 
      When the program is started by the user, the operating system calls the <b>Main</b> function once.</p>
    
    <p><b>Recursion</b> - when a given function calls itself. This results in something similar to an iterative loop that 
      requires a logical_expression for termination, otherwise, it repeats indefinitely:</p>

<pre class='pre'> 
public class Program
{
    public static void <b><span class='red'>Main</span></b>()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hold my beer");
        <b><span class='red'>Main</span></b>(); // The function <b>Main</b> is called
                // which calls itself, 
                // again and again infinitely
    }
}
</pre>

    <p>Here's an example of a <b>recursive</b> function in C# to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 /1+2+3+...+99+100/:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
public static int <b><span class='red'>SumR</span></b>(int n)
{
    if (n == 1) 
    {   // If n reaches 1, the execution is terminated;  
        // <b>logical_expression</b>
        return 1;
    }
    else 
    {   
        // If <b>n</b> &gt; <b>1</b>, return the current value of n + <b><span class='red'>SumR</span></b>(n - 1);
        return n + <b><span class='red'>SumR</span></b>(n - 1);
    }
}

// Usage of the <b>recursive</b> function :
int result = <b><span class='red'>SumR</span></b>(<b>100</b>);
Console.WriteLine(result); 

// Result: <b>5050</b>
</pre>

    <p>In this example, the <b>SumR</b> function takes an integer <b>n</b> as input and recursively calculates the sum of numbers 
      from <b>n</b> to 1. The logical expression for termination is when <b>n</b> becomes equal to 1, then the function returns 1. 
      Otherwise, it adds n to the result and recursively calls itself with the parameter n-1. Finally, we invoke 
      the <b>SumR</b> function with 100 as input and print the result.</p>
    
    <p>The same problem solved with a <b>for</b> loop:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
public static int <b><span class='red'>SumF</span></b>(int n)
{
    int sum = 0;
    
    for (int i = n; i &gt;= 1; i--)
    <b><span class='blu'>{</span></b>
        sum += i; // Equivalent to <b>sum = sum + i</b>: adding <b>i</b> to <b>sum</b>
    <b><span class='blu'>}</span></b>
    return sum;
}

// Usage of the <b>for</b> version /without <b>recursion</b>/:
int result = <b><span class='red'>SumF</span></b>(100);

Console.WriteLine(result); // Result: <b>5050</b>
</pre>

    <p>In this version, we initialize the variable <b>sum</b> with <b>0</b> and use
      the <b>for</b> loop for iteration from <b>100</b> to <b>1</b> (inclusive). The code inside
      the <b><span class='blu'>{ ... }</span></b> brackets is repeated in descending order, and
      with each iteration, the value of <b>i</b> is added to the variable <b>sum</b>,
      after which the value of <b>i</b> is decreased by <b>1</b>. Finally, the calculated sum
      is returned using <b>return</b>. This achieves the same result as the recursive version, but 
      without using recursion.</p>

    <h2 id='IV'>IV. Arrays</h2>
    <p><b>One-Dimensional Arrays</b></p>
    <p>In C#, a one-dimensional array is a collection of elements of the same data type that are stored in a contiguous 
      block of memory - similar to a sequence of numbers arranged in a row of a table. It is declared using square brackets 
      and a specific size, like this:</p>
      
<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = new int[5];
</pre>    

    <p>This creates an array of integers called `myArray` with a length of 5 elements. The array can be accessed using 
    index notation - 'myArray[<b>index</b>]'. The index of the array is always of type `int` - an integer, and the first 
    element is always at index 0:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = new int[5];

myArray[<b>0</b>] = 21;
myArray[<b>1</b>] = 52;
myArray[<b>2</b>] = 12;
myArray[<b>3</b>] = 14;
myArray[<b>4</b>] = 45;
</pre>
    
    <p>The values of the elements in the array can be assigned individually (as shown in the above example) or 
      through a loop:</p>
  
<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = new int[5];

for (int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Enter element[{i}]=");
    myArray[i] = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
}
</pre>

    <p>In C#, the first element of the array always has an index of 0. The last element has an 
      index of `array.Length - 1`.</p>
    <p>You can also declare and initialize an array in a single expression, like this:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = {21, 52, 12, 14, 45};
</pre>

  <p>This creates an array of integers called 'myArray' with the same values as in the previous example.</p>

  <p>An alternative way to iterate over the array is using the 'foreach' loop:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = {21, 52, 12, 14, 45};

foreach (int number in myArray )
{
    Console.WriteLine(number + " ; ");
}
</pre>
    
    <p>In this example, we have an integer array named 'myArray' with five elements. The 'foreach' loop iterates over each element 
    in the array and displays it on the screen. The result will be:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
21 ; 
52 ; 
12 ; 
14 ; 
45 ; 
</pre>

    <p>Arrays can be passed as parameters to methods, and arrays can be returned from methods. They can also be used in 
      combination with other data types, such as multidimensional arrays, jagged arrays, and arrays of objects.</p>
    <p><b>Algorithms</b></p>

    <p><b>Sum of Array Elements /Summation/</b></p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = {21, 52, 12, 14, 45};

int sum = 0; // sum accumulator, mandatory initialization to 0
             // if the accumulator is not initialized, it may have 
             // an arbitrary value, and the sum may not be accurate
             
foreach (int number in myArray )
{
    sum += number;
}

Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);

//Result:
Sum: 144
</pre>
    
    
    <p>The 'foreach' operator iterates over each element in the array and adds it to the variable 'sum'. After the 'foreach' loop 
      finishes, we print the total sum to the console.</p>
    <p>The 'foreach' operator is a convenient way to iterate over the elements of a one-dimensional array and perform operations 
      such as summing the values.</p>
    
    <p><b>Finding the Maximum Element /Filtering/</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = {21, 52, 12, 14, 45};

int indmx = 0; // index of the maximum element
               // with zero, it pints to the first element 

for (int i = 1; i &lt; myArray.Length; i++)
{
    if (myArray[indmx] &gt; myArray[i] )
    {
        indmx = i;
    }
}

Console.WriteLine($"Max element: myArray [{indmx}] = {myArray [indmx]} " );

// Result:
// Max element: myArray [1] = 52
</pre>                              
    
    <p>In this example, we initialize the variable <b>indmx</b> with the index of the first element in the array (0). 
      Then we iterate through the remaining elements of the array using a <b>for</b> loop. If an element at a given 
      index <b>i</b> is greater than the element at the current maximum index, we update <b>indmx</b> to the current 
      index (<b>indmx = i;</b>). Finally, we print the value of the maximum element.</p>
    
    <p><b>Printing the Parity of Array Elements /Filtering-2/</b></p>
          
<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = {21, 52, 12, 14, 45};

for (int i = 1; i &lt; myArray .Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"myArray[{i}]=" + myArray[i] + " - " + 
                     (myArray[i] % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd"));
}

// Result:
// myArray[0] = 21 - odd
// myArray[1] = 52 - even
// myArray[2] = 12 - even
// myArray[3] = 14 - even
// myArray[4] = 45 - odd
</pre>    
    
    <p>In this example, the <b>for</b> loop iterates over each element in the array of numbers. The expression <b>myArray[i] % 2 == 0</b> 
      checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (<b>%</b>) to check if there is no remainder (<b>0</b>) when dividing 
      by 2. If the logical expression evaluates to true, "even" is printed; otherwise, "odd" is printed.</p>
      
      <p><b>Summing Even and Odd Elements /Filtering+Summation/</b></p>
      
<pre class='pre'>
int[] myArray = {21, 52, 12, 14, 45};

int sumOfEven = 0;

foreach (int number in myArray)
{
    if (number % 2 == 0) 
        sumOfEven += number; // <b><span class='red'>!!! </span></b>Here, the curly braces {} of if/else blocks are
    else                     // intentionally omitted because when there is only one command/operation/line             
        sumOfOdd += number;  // in the if/else/for block, like in this case, they can be omitted, but
                             // <b><span class='red'>only in this case</span></b>.
}

Console.WriteLine("Sum of odd elements: " + sumOfOdd);
Console.WriteLine("Sum of even elements: " + sumOfEven);

// <b>Result</b>:
// Sum of odd elements: 66
// Sum of even elements: 78
</pre>


    <p>We use the <b>foreach</b> loop to iterate over each element in the array. For each element, we check if it is even or odd 
      using the modulus operator (%). If the number is even (divisible by 2), we add it to the <b>sumOfEven</b> variable. If it 
      is odd, we add it to the <b>sumOfOdd</b> variable. Finally, we print the sums of the odd and even elements.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: This example assumes that the array contains integers (int) because of the modulus operator (%) which 
    can only work with them.</p>

    <p>Bubble Sort Algorithm for sorting an array in ascending order. The outer <b>for</b> loop traverses the array from the first element 
      to the last element. The inner <b>for</b> loop traverses all elements to the right of it. If a given element is greater 
      than its right element, they are swapped to place the larger element from the right to the left. The process continues 
      until the array is fully sorted (traversed by the outer <b>for</b> loop).</p>

    <p>Swap Two Elements - way I</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
int a = 5; b = 10; 

// swap:
int tmp = a;       // tmp == 5
a = b;             // a == 10
b = tmp;           // b == 5
</pre>
    
    <p>Swap Two Elements - way II</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int a = 5; b = 10;

// swap:

b = a - b;    // b == 5
a = a - b;    // a == 10
</pre>

    <p>Finally, the sorted array is printed using the <b>foreach</b> operator.</p>
    
    <p><b>Arrays of Strings</b></p>
    <p>Arrays of strings are usually one-dimensional. The following example illustrates sorting an array of strings entered by the user:</p>
      

<pre class='pre'>
Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of strings:");
int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

string[] strings = new string[n];
Console.WriteLine("Enter the strings:");

for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
{
    strings[i] = Console.ReadLine();
}

Array.Sort(strings); // Sorting with the Sort method of the array

Console.WriteLine("Sorted strings:");
foreach (string str in strings)
{
    Console.WriteLine(str);
}
</pre>

    <p>In this example, the program prompts the user to enter the number of strings they want to input. Then, an array of 
      strings is created with the specified <b>n</b> number. Next, the program asks the user to enter the strings one 
      by one and stores them in the array. Finally, it sorts the array using <b>Array.Sort()</b> and prints the sorted 
      strings on the screen using the <b>foreach</b> operator.</p>

    <p><b>Sorting an array of strings in alphabetical order:</b></p>
    <p>The algorithm is the same as sorting a one-dimensional array, with the difference that it uses the <b>string.Compare</b> 
      function, which compares two strings and determines which one is greater based on the alphabetical order of the starting 
      letter. <b>string.Compare</b> returns an integer value that indicates the relationship between the two compared strings. 
      If the strings are equal, it returns 0. If the first string is smaller than the second, it returns a negative integer. If 
      the first string is greater than the second, it returns a positive integer.</p>
            
<pre class='pre'>
string s1 = "<b>Hold</b>", s2 = "<b>Beer</b>";
int result = string.Compare(s1, s2);

if (result &lt; 0) // result is a negative number because 
{                  // s1 &lt; s2, i.e., Beer &gt; Hold
     // swapping the positions of the two
     // elements in alphabetical order
     // because Beer starts with <b>B</b>, which comes before <b>H</b>
}
</pre>
 
    <p><b>Two-Dimensional and n-Dimensional Arrays</b></p>
    <p>In C#, a two-dimensional array is a rectangular table of elements with rows and columns. It is declared with 
    two dimensions, and the elements can be accessed using two indices.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of declaring and initializing a two-dimensional array in C#:</p>
    <p>int[,] matrix = new int[3, 4];</p>
    <p>In this example, we have declared a two-dimensional array named `matrix` with 3 rows and 4 columns. 
      The elements in the array are of type int. The indices of the array range from 0 to length minus 1 in each dimension.</p>
    <p>You can access and assign values to the array elements using the indices:</p>
    <p>matrix[0, 0] = 14;  // Assigning the value 14 to the element at row 0, column 0</p>
    <p>int value = matrix[1, 2];  // Reading the value of the element at row 1,

 
    <p>Here's an example of initializing a two-dimensional array with specific values using the array initializer syntax:</p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
int[,] matrix = {
    { 11, 12, 13, 14 },
    { 15, 16, 17, 18 },
    { 19, 20, 21, 22 }
};
</pre>

    <p>You can also use an iterative operator to iterate through the elements of a two-dimensional array:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int[,] matrix = {
    { 11, 12, 13, 14 },
    { 15, 16, 17, 18 },
    { 19, 20, 21, 22 }
};

for (int row = 0; row &lt; matrix.GetLength(0); row++)  // GetLength(0) -     Length of the first dimension == 3
{
    for (int col = 0; col &lt; matrix.GetLength(1); col++)  // GetLength(1) - Length of the second dimension == 4
    {
        int element = matrix[row, col];
        
        // Process the element
        Console.Write($" matrix[{row}][{col}]= {element} \t"); // tab specifier: /t
    }

    Console.WriteLine(); // new line
}

// Result:
// matrix[0][0]= 11        matrix[0][1]= 12        matrix[0][2]= 13        matrix[0][3]= 14 
// matrix[1][0]= 15        matrix[1][1]= 16        matrix[1][2]= 17        matrix[1][3]= 18 
// matrix[2][0]= 19        matrix[2][1]= 20        matrix[2][2]= 21        matrix[2][3]= 22 
</pre>

    <p>In this example, we use the GetLength method to determine the length of each dimension of the array.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that the sizes of a two-dimensional array are fixed at the time of creation and cannot 
      be changed later, except in some specific cases. If you need an array with a dynamic size or a jagged array, you 
      can use lists or jagged arrays instead.</p>

    <p><b>Jagged Arrays</b></p>
    <p>A jagged array, also known as an array of arrays, is an array where each sub-array can have a different length than the 
      others. In other words, it's an array of arrays that are not necessarily of the same size.</p>
    <p>To create a one-dimensional jagged array in C#, you declare an array variable with square brackets and initialize it with 
      the keyword "new" followed by the array size:</p>

<pre class='pre'>int[][] jaggedArray = new int[3][];</pre>

    <p>In this example, we create a jagged 2-dimensional array with three "rows," where each row can have a different length. 
      However, we haven't initialized each row with a specific number of elements yet.</p>
    <p>To initialize each row of the jagged array with a specific number of elements, you can assign a new array to each row:</p>
               
<pre class='pre'>
jaggedArray[0] = new int[4];
jaggedArray[1] = new int[2];
jaggedArray[2] = new int[3];
</pre>

    <p>In this example, we initialize the first row with four elements, the second row with two elements, and the third row with three elements.</p>
    <p>You can also initialize the jagged array with values by using nested iterative operators:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
int[][] jaggedArray = new int[3][];

jaggedArray[0] = new int[] { 11, 12, 13, 14 };    // Here, jaggedness occurs
jaggedArray[1] = new int[] { 15, 16 };            // because each row has
jaggedArray[2] = new int[] { 17, 18, 19 };        // a different number of elements

for (int r = 0; r &lt; jaggedArray.Length; r++)
{
    for (int c = 0; c &lt; jaggedArray[r].Length; c++)
    {
        Console.Write($"jagged[{r}][{c}] = {jaggedArray[r][c]} \t ");
    }
    Console.WriteLine(); // new line
}

// Result:
// jagged[0][0] = 11        jagged[0][1] = 12       jagged[0][2] = 13       jagged[0][3] = 14       
// jagged[1][0] = 15        jagged[1][1] = 16       
// jagged[2][0] = 17        jagged[2][1] = 18       jagged[2][2] = 19
</pre>

    <p><b>Symbolic Arrays</b></p>
    <p>In C#, you can treat a string as an array of characters and access individual characters by their index, 
       just like you would with an array. </p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
string s = "Hold my beer";
int len   = s.Length;

for( int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++ )
{
    Console.Write($" s[{i}] => {<span class='grn'>s[i]</span>} ");
    Console.WriteLine(); // new line
}

// Result:
// s[0] => H
// s[1] => o
// s[2] => l
// s[3] => d
// s[4] =>  
// s[5] => m
// s[6] => y 
// s[7] =>  
// s[8] => b
// s[9] => e
// s[10] => e
// s[11] => r
</pre>

    <p>In this example, the <b>s</b> variable holds the string <b>"Hold my beer"</b>. The characters within the string are 
      accessed using array-like indexing with the variable <b>i</b> in square brackets (<span class='grn'>s[i]</span>). 
      The first character is accessed using index 0, and the last one's index is 11
    </p>  




    <p><b>Dynamic Arrays</b></p>
    <p>If you need the array to dynamically expand, you can use <b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> instead of a traditional array. 
      The <b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> class provides a dynamic collection with the ability to change its size, which can be expanded 
      or contracted as needed. Here's an example of using List&lt;T&gt; to achieve dynamic expansion:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
<b>List&lt;int&gt; list = new List&lt;int&gt; { 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 };</b>
<b>list.Add(26);</b>
</pre>        

    <p>In this example, we create a list <b>List&lt;int&gt;</b>, which is of type <b>int</b>, and initialize it with the 
      values 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 using the array initializer syntax. Then the <b>Add</b> method is used to dynamically 
      add a new element, 26, at the end of the list. <b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> automatically handles resizing the underlying array 
      when adding elements. <b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> provides various methods and properties for working with dynamic lists, such as 
      adding, removing, inserting, and others. You can also access elements by their index using the square bracket notation (list[index]). 
      Note that <b>List&lt;T&gt;</b> provides dynamic resizing but has a slight performance overhead compared to a traditional array. 
      If you need the most memory-efficient and performant indexing, a manually resized array may be more suitable.</p>
    <p><b>Generic:</b> The type <b>List&lt;string&gt;</b> is called a generic type in C#. It is a class provided by the .NET platform 
      that represents a strongly typed collection of objects. The angle brackets <b>&lt;</b>string<b>&gt;</b> indicate that the list 
      is a list of strings.</p>
    <p><b>List:</b> Represents a generic collection of data of a given type that can store and manipulate a set of objects of 
      that type.</p>
    <p><b>&lt;string&gt;:</b> Specifies the type of objects (string) that the list will contain. It can be int, float, char, etc.</p>
    <p>By using the generic type <b>List&lt;string&gt;</b>, you declare a variable that can hold a collection of strings. The 
      methods of this variable  can be accessed using dot notation (list<b>.</b>Add, list<b>.</b>Count, etc.) to perform operations 
      on the list, such as adding or retrieving elements.</p>
    
    <p><b>Enum</b></p>
    <p>An <b>enum</b> (enumeration) in C# is a value type that represents a set of named constant values. It allows you to define 
      a collection of related named constant values, typically used to represent a set of possible values for a specific property or parameter.</p>
    <p>Example of an <b>enum</b></p>
 
<pre class='pre'>
enum DaysOfWeek
{
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday,
    Sunday
}

class Program 
{    
    static void Main()
    {
        // Usage of <b>enum</b>
        DaysOfWeek today = DaysOfWeek.Friday;
        Console.WriteLine(today);  
    }
}

// Result: 
// Friday
</pre>

    <p>In this example, the enumeration (<b>enum</b>) <b>DaysOfWeek</b> represents the days of the week, allowing you to 
      assign and work with different named constants.</p>

    <p><b>Structures</b></p>
    <p>Structures in C# are value types that can contain members - data and methods. They are used to create small and lightweight 
      objects and are typically used for small data-oriented scenarios. They are commonly used to represent simple data structures 
      such as coordinates (point.x, point.y), settings, dates, etc. Unlike classes, they do not support inheritance and are much 
      lighter (more optimized) than classes.</p>
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    
<pre class='pre'>
// Structure declaration
struct <b><span class='red'>Student</span></b>
{
    public string <b><span class='blu'>name</span></b>;
    public int    <b><span class='lil'>age</span></b>;
    public double <b><span class='grn'>averageMark</span></b>;
}  

class Program 
{    
    static void Main()
    {
        // <b>Usage:</b>
        <b><span class='red'>Student </span></b>student1     = new Student();
        student1.<b><span class='blu'>name</span></b>        = "John Doe";
        student1.<b><span class='lil'>age</span></b>         = 20;
        student1.<b><span class='grn'>averageMark</span></b> = 5.50;
                                                             
        <b><span class='red'>Student </span></b>student2     = new Student();        
        student2.<b><span class='blu'>name</span></b>        = "Jane Smith";
        student2.<b><span class='lil'>age</span></b>         = 21;
        student2.<b><span class='grn'>averageMark</span></b> = 5.75;
                
        // If we do: 
        student2 = student1;
        // Then, the data from <b>student1</b> is <b><span class='red'>copied</span></b> onto the data of <b>student2</b>

    <h2 id='V'>V. Object-Oriented Programming Basics</h2>
    
    <p><b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> (OOP) is a programming principle that organizes code into <b>objects</b>, which are instances 
      of <b>classes</b>. It focuses on the ideas of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular, reusable, and easily 
      maintainable and extensible code. OOP encourages organizing code into independent and loosely connected objects.</p>
    <p>A class is defined using the <b>class</b> keyword followed by the class name. Once you have defined a class, you can 
      create instances (objects) of that class using the <b>new</b> keyword. Creating an object allows you to create multiple 
      instances of the class, each with its own set of data and behavior. The behavior of an object is determined by the 
      <b>methods/functions</b> of the class, which contain the actions or operations that an object can perform.</p>
    
    <p><b>Classes, Objects, and Methods.</b></p>
    <p>Classes consist of fields/variables and methods/functions.</p>
    <p><b>Classes</b>: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties/variables, methods/functions, and 
      events that an object can have.</p>
    <p><b>Objects</b>: An object is an instance of a class. It has all the properties, methods, and events defined in the class.</p>
    <p><b>Fields</b>: Fields are the attributes of an object. They define the state of an object and can be read or modified. They 
      typically represent variables (or member variables).</p>
    <p><b>Properties</b>: Properties are fields/variables that have special <b>Get</b>/<b>Set</b> methods, which modify their 
      values (e.g., for data validation purposes, such as a student's grade cannot be 8.00 ➜ the grade cannot be below 2.00 or 
      above 6.00).</p>
    <p><b>Methods</b>: Methods are the actions that an object can perform. They define the behavior of an object and can accept 
      parameters and return values. (They represent functions.)</p>
    <p><b>Constructors</b>: Constructors are special <b>methods/functions</b> that are called when an object is created. 
      They are used to initialize the properties/variables of the object and perform any necessary pre-work during the object's creation. The constructor's name is always the same as the class name.</p>        
        
<pre class='pre'>
public class <b><span class='blu'>MyClass </span></b>// The name of the class <b>always</b> matches the name of the constructor
{
     private int myNumber;       // Member - variable
     public <b><span class='blu'>MyClass</span></b>(int number)  // Constructor, called when 
     {                           // Object of this class with the keyword <b>new</b>
          myNumber = number;     // initialization of a member variable from
                                 // the constructor 
                                                   
          Console.WriteLine("MyClass - Constructor: " + number); 
     }
     
     public void MyMethod(string s)
     {
        Console.WriteLine("MyMethod: " + s);
     }

     
     // .......
}
                                                     
// ....                                              
                                                     
class Program 
{    
    static void Main()
    {

    }
}    


// Result:

// MyMethod: Hold my beer

    <p><b>Disposable Object</b>: The <b>using</b> statement in C# is used to ensure that a disposable object is properly
      released when it is no longer needed. It provides a convenient way to automatically clean up resources and release
      them back to the system.</p>
            
<pre class='pre'>
<b>using </b> (StreamReader <b>reader</b> = <b>new</b> StreamReader("<b>Program.cs</b>"))
{
    string s =  reader.ReadToEnd();
    Console.WriteLine(s);
}   // the disposable object reader is released after '}'


// Result /Content of the Program.cs file/:
 
// using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("Program.cs"))
// {
//     string s =  reader.ReadToEnd();
//     Console.WriteLine(s);
// }   // the disposable object reader is released after '}'
</pre>
   
    <p>Within the <b>using</b> block, you can perform operations on the <b>reader</b> object. In this case, <b>reader.ReadToEnd()</b> is called
      to read the contents of the file <b>Program.cs</b> into the string <b>s</b>. When the code execution reaches the end of the <b>using</b> block,
      the <b>Dispose()</b> method of the <b>reader</b> object is automatically called. This ensures that all resources occupied by the <b>reader</b>   object are properly released, such as closing network connections or freeing up memory.</p>
            
    <p><b>Finalizers</b>: Finalizers are usually not necessary as C# has garbage collectors that take care of freeing
      the memory occupied by objects that are no longer needed in a program. This <b>method</b> is automatically called
      by the garbage collector when it starts freeing the memory occupied by the object. The finalizer always has the same
      name as the class, but starts with the <b><span class='red'>~ </span></b> sign:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
<b><span class='red'>~</span></b><b>ClassName</b>()
{
    // Finalizer code goes here.
}
</pre>

    <p><b>Indexer</b> - /indexer/ is a mechanism /<b>Get/Set</b> methods/ that allows accessing objects in an array using indexing syntax.
      It provides the ability to define <b>Get</b>/<b>Set</b> methods. Indexers also allow <b>string</b> indices, such as: days['index1'], days['index2'] /if <b>days</b> is an indexed array/. You can specify the behavior for retrieving or setting values based on the provided 
      index using the <b>Get/Set</b> methods, which can make accessing and manipulating data in your class more convenient.</p>

    <p>The class MyCollection demonstrates the use of an <b>indexer</b> that allows accessing elements in the data array using indexing syntax.</p>

<pre class='pre'>
// Example of a class with an <b>indexer</b>

    <p><b>Method Modifiers</b></p>
    <p><b>Static / Non-static Methods</b>: Static methods are methods that belong to the class rather than an instance of the class. They can 
      be called without creating an object of the class.</p> <p>Static methods are useful when you need to perform an action that is not 
      specific to a particular class. For example, a static method can be used to perform a calculation or retrieve a value that does not depend 
      on the state of a particular object and is not associated with it. To declare a static method, you use the keyword <b>static</b> in the 
      method's signature. For example:</p>
        
<pre class='pre'>
public class Calculator
{
    public static int AplusB(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Program 
{    
    static void Main()
    {
        // No need to create an object, it is called in the following way:
        int result = Calculator.AplusB(10, 20); // the value of <b>result</b> variable after this line is 30
        Console.WriteLine("10 + 20 = " + result);
    }
}   

// Result:
// 10 + 20 = 30
</pre>

    <p>It is appropriate to use static methods or variables when you want to perform a common operation that does not rely on the state
      of a specific object, or when you want to share a value among all objects of a given class /1 common field - a variable that is the same for 
      all objects of the class/. Additionally, static variables can create problems with concurrency /multitasking - simultaneous execution/ if multiple threads try to access or modify them simultaneously. Therefore, it is generally a good idea to limit the use of static methods and variables in Result.</p>
    <p><b>How to create an object and call its method</b>?
    </p> <p>Add a non-static method /by default, all methods and fields are non-static if it is not specified that they are static/ to a 
      class - <b>void MyMethod()</b>:</p>

            
<pre class='pre'>
namespace HoldMyBeer  // namespace is used to group classes that perform
                      // similar /common/ tasks
{
    class MyClass // class MyClass
    {
        public void &lt;b&gt;MyMethod&lt;/b&gt;() // Method - a user-defined function, non-static
        {
            Console.WriteLine(" ------ MyMethod called ! ------ ");
        }
    }        
        
    class Program 
    {    
        static void &lt;b&gt;Main&lt;/b&gt;(string[] args)
        {
            &lt;b&gt;MyClass p = new MyClass(); // &lt;span class='red'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; - creating an object &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt; of the class 
                                       // &lt;b&gt;MyClass&lt;/b&gt; in the variable &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;.MyMethod(); // Calling MyMethod

            // after working with the object, it is not necessary to release it;    
            // this is taken care of by the so-called Garbage Collector
        }
    }
}
</pre>

    <p>Since the <b>Main</b> function is static, it is called from the environment without the need to create an instance of the Program class, 
      but to call the MyMethod function, we need to create an object of the Program class. If MyMethod were <b>static</b>, we could have called it like: MyMethod();</p> <p><b>Passing Parameters to the Main Function</b></p> <p>From the command line, when starting the program, you can pass
      parameters to the <b>Main</b> function. This is done as follows:</p> 

<pre class='pre'>
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(<b>string[] args</b>)
    {
        if (args.Length &gt;= 2) 
        {
            string inputString = args[0];
            int inputNumber = Convert.ToInt32(args[1]);
            Console.WriteLine("Input String: " + inputString);
            Console.WriteLine("Input Number: " + inputNumber);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Please provide both a string and an integer parameter.");
        }
    }
}
</pre>

    <p>To pass a string and an integer parameter when running the program from the command line, you need to enter:</p>
    <p><b>dotnet run "Hold my beer" 42</b></p>
    <p><b>Result:</b></p>
    <p>Input String: Hold my beer</p>
    <p>Input Number: 42</p>
    
    <p>In this example, the <b>Main</b> method has a parameter args, which is an array of command-line arguments passed to the program. We check
      if there are at least two arguments <b>(args.Length &gt;= 2)</b> and then extract the first argument as a string (<b>args[0]</b>)
      and the second argument as an integer /<b>int</b>/ using <b>Convert.ToInt32(args[1])</b>. Then we display on the screen the string and 
      number passed as parameters using Console.WriteLine.</p>
      
    <p><b>Passing Parameters to Methods /ref, return ref/ :</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
static void AddOne(<b>ref </b>int x) // <b>ref</b> - changes the value of the passed variable.
{
    x += 1;
}

static void AddTwo(int x) // without <b>ref</b> - the value of the passed  
                          // variable is not changed.
{
    x += 2;
}

int num = 5; 
AddOne(<b>ref</b> num);
Console.WriteLine(num); // Output: 6; num has been changed by <b>AddOne</b>.

AddTwo(num);
Console.WriteLine(num); // Output: 6; num has not been changed by <b>AddOne</b>.
</pre>

    <p><b>ref</b> can be used when returning a Result from a method:</p> 
    <p>return <b>ref</b> number;</p>
    <p>but it is recommended to be avoided as it leads to confusing code.</p>
    
    <p><b>in/out</b> function parameters</p>
    <p>In C#, function parameters can be defined as <b>in</b> or <b>out</b>.</p>
    <p><b>in</b> parameters are used for passing values to a function by reference (<b>ref</b>), without allowing changes. 
      They are used for input values that should not be modified in the function.</p>
    <p><b>out</b> parameters are used for returning values by reference, allowing the function to modify them. They are usually 
      used when a function needs to return multiple values. The calling code must explicitly pass a variable to the <b>out</b> 
      parameter before invoking the function.</p>
    
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
static void AddAndMultiply(int a, int b, out int sum, out int product)
{
    sum = a + b;
    product = a * b;
}

// You can use this function as follows:

int num1 = 5;
int num2 = 3;
int resultSum, resultProduct;
AddAndMultiply(num1, num2, out resultSum, out resultProduct);

Console.WriteLine($"Sum: {resultSum}");
Console.WriteLine($"Product: {resultProduct}");

<b>// Result:</b>
// Sum: 8
// Product: 15
</pre>
     <p>In this example, the function AddAndMultiply takes <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> as <b>in</b> parameters and assigns the <b>sum</b> 
      and <b>product</b> of <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> to the output parameters <b>resultSum</b> and <b>resultProduct</b> respectively.</p>

    <p><b>Getters</b> and <b>setters</b> are used to control access to the fields or properties of a class. They provide a way to read, 
      write, or manipulate the data stored in those fields or properties. <b>Getters</b> allow you to retrieve the value of a field or 
      property, while <b>setters</b> allow you to change or update that value. Additionally, <b>Getters</b> and <b>setters</b> can add 
      logic or validate the data when accessing or modifying it, which can help prevent incorrect data formats—for example, if a value 
      needs to be a number greater than 0.</p>
    <p>The example below shows how a combination of <b>Methods</b> and <b>fields</b> is used to build the Student class, which has a 
      Name field and an Age field:</p>


<pre class='pre'>
class Student { // Student class
    // fields
    private string name; // private field for the student's name
    private int age;     // private field for the student's age
    
    public int publicAge = 0; // public field for access testing
    
    // Constructors
    public Student() { // constructor that sets  
                       // default values for the fields
        name = "Unknown";
        age = 0;
    }

    public Student(string name, int age) { // Constructor that takes name and age as arguments
        <b>this</b>.name = name; // We use the keyword "<b>this</b>"  
                          // to refer to the name field of the current object
        <b>this</b>.age = age;   // We use the keyword "<b>this</b>"    
                          // to refer to the age field of the current object
    }

    // <b>Properties</b>
    public string Name {         // property for accessing the Name field
        get { return name;  }    // Getter method that returns the value of the name field
        set { name = value; }    // Setter method for setting the value of the name field
    }

    public int Age { // public property for accessing the <b>Age</b> field
        get { return age; }   // Getter method that returns the value of the age field 
        set {   // Setter method for setting the value of the age field 
                if (value >= 18 ) age = value; 
                else Console.WriteLine("Invalid age:" + value); 
            } 
    }
    
    // <b>Methods</b>
    public void PrintInfo() { // public method that prints  
                              // the student's name and age
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + name);
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + age);
    }
}

    <p><b>Object-Oriented Programming - Advanced Topics</b> </p>
    <p>These are rules that are useful and widely used in Object-Oriented Software Development.</p>
    <p><b>Encapsulation</b>: Encapsulation helps in organizing and structuring code by grouping related data and behavior into objects. 
      This principle provides data hiding, allowing the internal details of an object to be hidden. It promotes code modularity, 
      reusability, and maintenance.</p>
    <p><b>Inheritance</b>: Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes, methods, 
      and behavior. This principle encourages code reuse and extensibility, as you can define common functionality in a base class and 
      inherit specialized classes from it. Inheritance helps in creating a hierarchical structure, expressing relationships between classes.</p>
    <p><b>Polymorphism</b>: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly through a common interface. It enables 
      code to be written in a generic way, treating different objects in the same manner, standardizing their usage.</p>
    <p><b>Abstraction</b>: Abstraction allows you to focus on the essential characteristics and behavior while hiding irrelevant details. 
      It helps in creating simplified and reusable models of complex systems. Abstraction maintains information hiding, reduces 
      complexity, and improves code understandability.</p>
    <p><b>Modularity and Maintenance</b>: Object-oriented programming encourages modular design, where code is organized into 
      separate modules (classes or namespaces). This improves code organization, reduces dependencies, and facilitates maintenance 
      and improvement of the codebase over time.</p>
    <p><b>Inheritance</b></p>
    <p>Inheritance is an idea in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another 
      class.</p>
    <p>Inheritance is achieved by creating a new class, called the <b>derived</b> class (or subclass), from an existing class called 
      the <b>base</b> class (or superclass). The derived class inherits all the members (fields, properties, methods) of the base class, 
      allowing you to reuse them and extend the functionality of the base class by adding new fields, properties, and methods.</p>
    <p>Inheritance promotes <b>code reuse</b> by allowing you to define common attributes and behaviors in a base class and reuse them 
      in multiple different derived classes. This eliminates the need for code duplication, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.</p>
    <p>Inheritance allows the creation of a <b>hierarchy</b> of classes, where classes are organized in a hierarchical structure based on 
      their relationships. Derived classes can specialize and extend the behavior of the base class by adding new members or 
      overriding existing ones.</p>
    <p>Inheritance supports the following <b>relationships</b>:</p>
    <p>• "class X <b>is-a</b> class Y" - This phrase implies a direct inheritance relationship, 
      where class <b>X</b> is a specific kind of class <b>Y</b>. It means that class <b>X</b> inherits from class <b>Y</b> and shares 
      its properties, methods, and behavior. This relationship is based on <b>specialization</b>, indicating that class <b>X</b> is a 
      specialized version or subtype of class <b>Y</b>. For example, if we have a class called Animal and a class called Dog, we can 
      say that "Dog <b>is-an</b> Animal".</p>
      
    <p>•"class X <b>is-a-kind-of</b> class Y" implies a more general relationship where class <b>X</b> belongs to a broader category or type
      represented by class <b>Y</b>. It indicates that class <b>X</b> is one of several different types that fall within the category 
      represented by class <b>Y</b>. The "<b>is-a-kind-of</b>" relationship is based on <b>categorization</b> or <b>classification</b>. 
      For example, if we have a class called Vehicle, and classes like Car, Bike, and Bus, we can say that "Car, Bike, and Bus <b>is-a-kind-of</b> Vehicle".</p> 
    <p>In summary, the "class X <b>is-a</b> class Y" relationship signifies a direct inheritance relationship where class <b>X</b> is a 
      specialized version of class <b>Y</b>. The "class X <b>is-a-kind-of</b> class Y" relationship shows that class <b>X</b> belongs to a 
      broader category represented by class <b>Y</b>.</p>
    <p>Inheritance plays a key role in achieving <b>polymorphism</b>, which is the ability of objects of different types to be treated as 
      objects of a common base type. Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different derived classes through 
      a common interface (a set of functions, methods, fields, properties), providing flexibility and extensibility.</p>
    <p>Inheritance allows derived classes to <b>override</b> (replace) the methods and properties of the base class. Additionally, derived 
      classes can access members of the base class (that are not <b>private</b>), allowing them to reuse and extend the behavior defined in 
      the base class.</p>
    <p>In summary, inheritance provides a way to establish relationships between classes and encourages code reuse. It allows you to create 
      class hierarchies, specialize behavior, and build more flexible and modular applications.</p>
    <p><b>Class Inheritance</b></p>
    <p>To create a derived class in C#, you use the colon character (:) after the name of the derived class, followed by the name of the 
      base class. This establishes the inheritance relationship between the two classes. Then, the derived class can extend or modify the functionality of the base class by adding new members
      or overriding existing ones. In C#, a class can inherit only one base class.</p>
    <p><b>Example</b>:</p>      
      
<pre class='pre'>
// Base class
class <b><span class='lil'>Vehicle</span></b>
{
     public string <b><span class='blu'>Brand </span></b>{ get; set; } = "";

                              // class, but with a different signature /it doesn't have an <b>int liters</b> parameter/
     {                        
         Console.WriteLine("Car Class    : Fuel Checked.");
     }
     
     public void <b><span class='grn'>Accelerate</span></b>() // adding a new method in the Vehicle class

    <p>In this example, the class "<b>Car</b>" inherits the base class "<b>Vehicle</b>". As a result, the <b>Car</b> class automatically
      gains access to the <b>Brand</b> property and the <b>Start</b> method defined in the base class <b>Vehicle</b>. Additionally, 
      the <b>Car</b> class introduces its own method called <b>Accelerate</b>.</p>
    <p>To replace a method in C#, you use the <b>override</b> keyword in the derived class. The method in the derived class must have
      the same <b>name</b>, <b>type</b>, and <b>parameters</b> as the method in the base class, and it must be marked as <b>virtual</b>. Method
      overriding allows you to customize the behavior of the method in the base class to suit the needs of the derived class while still using 
      a common interface defined in the base class. If you have an object of the base class with an overridden method in the derived class, the
      version of the method to be executed (the base version or the overridden version) is determined at runtime based on the type of the object. 
      This is known as <b>late binding</b>.</p>
    <p><b>Late binding</b> is achieved by using the <b>virtual</b>, <b>override</b>, and <b>base</b> keywords. The <b>virtual</b> keyword is used 
      to declare a method in the base class as eligible for replacement, and the <b>override</b> keyword is used in the derived class to indicate 
      that a given method replaces a method in the base class. The <b>base</b> keyword is used to refer to the base class from the derived class,
      allowing you to call the method/field of the base class from the inherited overridden method.</p> 
    <p>The <b>base</b> keyword is used to refer to the base class from the derived class. It provides access to members (methods, properties, 
      fields) of the base class that are overridden in the derived class /but only if they are protected or public/.</p>
    <p>The <b>this</b> keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to access members (fields, properties, methods) of the 
      current class. It allows access to methods/fields of the current class. Explicitly using <b>this</b> helps to distinguish between fields 
      and methods of the current class and fields and methods of its base class when they have the same name.</p> 
    <p><b>Modifiers of methods/classes (besides):</b></p>
    <p>•<b> sealed</b>: This keyword indicates that a <b>class/method</b> cannot be inherited. It is useful to prevent unwanted modifications 
      or extensions. By sealing a class, you ensure that its behavior remains unchanged and cannot be replaced by derived classes.</p>
    <p>•<b> abstract</b>: This keyword indicates that the given methods must be implemented by inheriting <b>classes/methods</b>.</p>
    <p>•<b> virtual</b>: This keyword indicates that a <b>method</b> can be overridden in inheriting classes.</p>
    <p>•<b> override</b>: This keyword indicates that a <b>method</b> replaces/overrides a method in the base class.</p>
    
    
    <p><b>Access Modifiers for Methods/Fields</b></p>
    <p>•<b>public</b>: A public member can be accessed from any location in the code, whether it's from the same class, a derived class, 
      or a different assembly (executable .exe file plus any dependent .dll files). It provides the highest level of accessibility. 
      <b>public</b> is often used for members that need to be accessed from multiple parts of a program or from external components. 
      When a class or interface is marked as <b>public</b>, it means it can be instantiated or inherited by other code.</p>
    <p>•<b>private</b>: A private member can only be accessed by the same class. This is the default access modifier for class members 
      if no access modifier is specified. <b>private</b> encapsulates the details of their implementation and hides them from other 
      parts of the program. This helps maintain data integrity and encourages better organization and encapsulation of code, allowing 
      for better control over the internal workings of the class.</p>
    <p>•<b>protected</b>: A protected member can be accessed by the same class or derived classes, but not outside the class or assembly. 
      They are not accessible outside the class hierarchy. The <b>protected</b> modifier is useful when you want to share certain members 
      with derived inheriting classes while keeping them hidden from other unrelated classes. This aids code reuse and encourages proper 
      relationships between classes in the hierarchy.</p>
    <p>•<b>internal</b>: An internal member can be accessed within the same assembly but not outside of it. <b>internal</b> provides a 
      way to encapsulate execution details and hide them from external code. It helps with organizing and partitioning the code into 
      logical units within a project or solution. This promotes code encapsulation and modularity.</p>
    <p>•<b>protected internal</b>: A protected internal member can be accessed by the same assembly or derived classes in other assemblies. 
      It combines the accessibility of <b>protected</b> and <b>internal</b>.</p>
    <p>•<b>private protected:</b> Members can be accessed within the defining class as well as by all derived classes defined in the same 
      assembly. However, they cannot be accessed by derived classes in other assemblies. It allows access within the same assembly but 
      not outside of it or by non-derived classes in other assemblies.</p>
    <p>Example with <b>private protected</b> and inheritance of class <b>MyClass</b> from class <b>MyDerivedClass</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
using System;
namespace MyNamespace
{
    class MyClass
    {
        <b>private protected </b>int myInt = 42;
    }
    
    class MyDerivedClass : MyClass // We inherit <b>MyDerivedClass</b> from the class <b>MyClass</b>
    {
        void MyMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(myInt); // This is allowed because MyDerivedClass  
                                      // is in the same assembly as MyClass.
        }
    }
    
    class Program 
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            MyDerivedClass ob = new MyDerivedClass();
            ob.MyMethod();
        }
    }
    
}

// Result:
// 42
</pre>

    <p><b>Interfaces</b></p>
    <p>Interfaces in C# provide a way to define a <b>contract</b> - a set of methods, properties, events, or variables that the inheriting 
      class must have / implement.</p>
    <p>Interfaces define members: Interfaces can include method signatures, property declarations, event declarations, and indexer 
      declarations. The set of these members defines the <b>contract</b> that inheriting classes must adhere to.</p>
    <p>Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces, forming a hierarchy of inheritance. A class that implements a certain interface also 
      implements all the interfaces inherited by that interface.</p>
    <p>Implementing interfaces: A class can implement one or <b>multiple</b> interfaces by providing the necessary implementation for 
      each member defined in the interface(s), unlike when a class inherits only <b>one</b> base class. Example:</p>
            
<pre class='pre'>
class MyClass : Interface1, Interface2 // <b>MyClass</b> inherits <b>Interface1</b> and <b>Interface2</b> 
{
    // Class implementation
}
</pre>

    <p>Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction, polymorphism, and code reusability. They allow you to write code that works 
      with objects of different classes, as long as they implement the required interface. They assist in promoting <b>loose coupling</b>, 
      modularity, and flexibility in your code, making it easier to write maintainable and extensible applications.</p>
    <p><b>Loose coupling</b> is a principle in object-oriented programming that promotes the independence and flexibility of components or 
      modules within a system from other components or modules. It emphasizes reducing dependencies between components, allowing them to 
      be easily replaced without affecting other parts of the system. It helps improve code maintainability, reusability, and testability, 
      as well as facilitating modular and scalable software architectures.</p>
    <p><b>Example of an interface:</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
using System;

// Definition of an <b>interface</b>
public <b>interface <span class='blu'>IShape</span></b>
{
    double <b>CalculateArea</b>(); // Classes that implement this 
                            // interface must have this method  
                            // as part of the <b>contract</b>.
}

// Implementing the <b>IShape</b> interface in the <b>Circle</b> class. 
public class <b>Circle</b> : <b><span class='blu'>IShape</span></b>
{
    private double radius;
    public <b>Circle</b>(double radius)  // The constructor of the <b>Circle</b> class.
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    public double <b><span class='red'>CalculateArea</span></b>() // The <b>IShape</b> interface "requires" us to have such a method 
    {                             // in the <b>Circle</b> class through a "contract".
        return Math.PI * Math.Pow(radius, 2);
    }
}


// Implementing the <b>IShape</b> interface in the <b>Rectangle</b> class. 
public class <b>Rectangle </b>: <b><span class='blu'>IShape </span></b>
{
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public <b>Rectangle</b>(double width, double height) // The constructor of the <b>Rectangle</b> class.
    {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public double <b><span class='ora'>CalculateArea</span></b>() // The <b>IShape</b> interface "requires" us to have such a 
                                  // method in the <b>Rectangle</b> class through a "contract".
    {                             
        return width * height;
    }
}

// Using the <b>interface</b>
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Creating 2 objects that implement the <b>IShape</b> interface. 
        // We create them from different classes with <b>new</b>
        <b><span class='blu'>IShape </span></b>circle = new Circle(5); // both objects are of type <b>IShape</b>.
        <b><span class='blu'>IShape </span></b>rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);   
         
        // Calling the method of the <b>interface</b> on different objects:
        // 1. Calling the <b><span class='red'>CalculateArea</span> method from the Circle class:</b>
        double circleArea = circle.<b><span class='red'>CalculateArea</span></b>();

        // 2. Calling the <b><span class='ora'>CalculateArea</span> method from the Rectangle class:</b>
double rectangleArea = rectangle.<b><span class='ora'>CalculateArea</span></b>();

        // 3. Displaying the Result
        Console.WriteLine("Circle area: " + circleArea);
        Console.WriteLine("Rectangle area: " + rectangleArea);
    }
}

// Result:
// Circle area: 78.53981633974483
// Rectangle area: 24
</pre>


    <p>In this example, we define an interface called <b><span class='blu'>IShape</span></b> that declares the method <b>CalculateArea</b>(). 
      Then we implement the <b><span class='blu'>IShape</span></b> interface in two classes: <b>Circle</b> and <b>Rectangle</b>, providing 
      their own implementations of the <b>CalculateArea</b> method.</p>
    <p>In the <b>Program</b> class, we create objects of type <b>Circle</b> and <b>Rectangle</b> and assign them to variables of type 
      <b><span class='blu'>IShape</span></b>. This is possible because they implement the same interface, <b><span class='blu'>IShape</span></b>. 
      Then we call the <b>CalculateArea</b>() method for each object, and the appropriate implementation of the method is automatically invoked 
      based on the actual type of the object. This demonstrates how interfaces allow us to work with objects of different classes through a 
      common interface, enabling polymorphism and providing flexibility in code usage.</p>
    <p><b>Serialization</b> and <b>deserialization</b> of classes refer to the process of converting objects into a format that can be 
      stored or transmitted, such as binary, XML, or JSON. Serialization preserves the state of an object or allows it to be sent over 
      the network. Deserialization is the process of recreating an object from its serialized form. C# provides built-in mechanisms for 
      serialization and deserialization, such as <b>BinaryFormatter</b>, <b>XmlSerializer</b>, and <b>JsonSerializer</b> (JSON - JavaScript 
      Object Notation - a string format with direct support from the client-side programming language in web browsers, JavaScript, as well 
      as most modern programming languages). These classes allow you to easily package objects in a serialized format and unpack them back 
      into objects. Serialization is useful in scenarios such as data persistence, data loading, inter-process communication, and 
      communication between programs written in different programming languages. It enables objects to be stored or transmitted in 
      a structured manner while preserving their state.</p>


<pre class='pre'>
using System;
using System.Text.Json; // Library for JSON serialization

class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Object to be serialized
        var person = new Person
        {
            Name = "John Doe",
            Age = 30
        };
        
        // Serialization of the object into <b>JSON</b> string
        string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(person);
        
        // Printing the resulting <b>JSON</b> string on the screen
        Console.WriteLine($"JSON string: {jsonString}");
        
        // Deserialization of the <b>JSON</b> string back into an object
        var deserializedPerson = JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;Person&gt;(jsonString);
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {deserializedPerson.Name});
        Console.WriteLine($"Age: {deserializedPerson.Age}");
    }
}

<b>// Result</b>:
// JSOn string: {"Name":"John Doe","Age":30}
// Name: John Doe
// Age: 30 
</pre>

    <p>In this example, we define a class <b>Person</b> with properties <b>Name</b> and <b>Age</b>.We create an instance of 
      the <b>Person</b> class, serialize it into a <b>JSON</b> string using <b>JsonSerializer.Serialize</b>, then print the resulting 
      serialized <b>JSON</b> string on the screen, deserialize it back into an object using <b>JsonSerializer.Deserialize</b>,
      and finally print the values of the deserialized object's properties - <b>Name</b> and <b>Age</b>.</p>

    <p>In addition to single objects, we can also serialize and list /dynamic array/ of multiple objects, and write them to a file. 
      The command <b>echo "[]" > data.json</b> creates the file <b>data.json</b> with the content <b>[]</b> to have a valid JSON file 
      that can be loaded.</p>

    <h2 id='VII'>VII. Events, Exceptions, Files</h2>

    <p><b>Events</b></p>
    
    <p>Events in C# are a way of communication between components or objects. They allow one object to notify other objects when a specific 
      action or state change occurs. An event consists of an event handler - a <b>method</b> that is automatically invoked when the event 
      is raised.</p>
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre class='pre'>
// Define a class with an event
class Button
{
    // Define the event
    public event EventHandler Click;
    // Method to raise the event
    public void OnClick()
    {
        // Check if any subscribers are registered
        if (Click != null)
        {
            // Raise the event
            Click(this, EventArgs.Empty);
        }
    }
}

// Usage example
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Button button = new Button();
        // Subscribe to the Click event
        button.Click += Button_Click;
        
        // Simulate a button click
        button.OnClick();
    }
    
    static void Button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Button clicked!");
    }
}
</pre>

    <p>In this example, we define a class <b>Button</b> with the <b>Click</b> event. The <b>Button</b> class also has a method <b>OnClick</b>() 
      that triggers the event. In the <b>Main</b>() method, we create an instance of the <b>Button</b> class, 
      <b><span class='red'>subscribe</span></b> to the <b>Click</b> event using the <b><span class='red'>+=</span></b> operator, and then 
      simulate a button click by calling the <b>OnClick</b>() method. When the event is raised, the <b>Button_Click</b> method is executed, 
      and it displays the message "Button clicked!" in the console.</p> <p><b>Note</b>: In real-world scenarios, events are often used in 
      significantly more complex systems with multiple subscribers and event arguments. When developing a Windows Forms application, you can 
      attach events to various controls such as <b>buttons</b>, <b>text fields</b>, or <b>menus</b>. These events are triggered when the 
      associated event is raised, allowing you to write code that responds to user actions such as button clicks, mouse movements, or keyboard 
      input. Similarly, you can handle events like <b>TextChanged</b>, <b>KeyPress</b>, <b>MouseEnter</b>, and many others to control the 
      behavior of your application based on user interactions. By using events, you can create interactive and responsive user interfaces 
      in <b>Windows Forms</b> applications.</p>
      
    <hr>
      
    <p><b>Exception Handling</b></p>
    <p>When working with various functions, especially on the internet, exceptions/errors may occur, such as a connection interruption, an 
      error during the execution of a specific function, etc. In such cases, a <b>try/catch/finally block</b> can be used to handle
      exceptions/errors. The function that may cause an error is placed in the <b>try</b> block; the error message is displayed in 
      the <b>catch</b> block; and the object that caused the error is cleaned up in the <b>finally</b> block. The following example throws 
      an error when attempting to convert a string to an <b>int</b> (integer).</p>
            
<pre class='pre'>
int a = 10;
try {
    a = int.Parse("300");          
    Console.WriteLine("a = " + a); // Ok 
    a = int.Parse("Hold my beer"); // Rise exception!
    Console.WriteLine("a = " + a); // Never reached
} 
catch ( FormatException ex )       // <span class='grn'>Save the day</span>
{
    Console.WriteLine("0. EXCEPTION! Beer NOT hold, Reason : " + <span class='yel'>ex.Message</span> );
}

a = int.Parse("Hold my beer");             // <span class='red'>Rise exception! ➜ &#x2716; Program termination &#x2716;</span>
Console.WriteLine("2. Beer on hold:" + a); // Never reached 


// Result:
// a = 300
// 0. EXCEPTION! Beer NOT hold, Reason : <span class='yel'>The input string 'Hold my beer' was not in a correct format.</span>
// Unhandled exception. System.FormatException: The input string 'Hold my beer' was not in a correct format.

    Interface - a standard service on the internet that returns <b>JSON</b> strings from a given web address. For example, 
    <a href='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/' target='_blank' class='lnk'>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/</a> open it with the 
    mouse <b>!!!</b> / using the <b>HttpClient</b> object and handling potential errors <b>/exceptions/</b> with 
    a <b>try/catch/finally</b> block:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
using System;
using System.Net.Http; // Required for the HttpClient object
class Program
{
    // The <b>Main</b> function is <b>async</b> 
    <b><span class='blu'>static async System.Threading.Tasks.Task </span></b>Main()
    {
        HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
        string url = <span class='blu'>"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"</span>;
        <b>try</b>
        {
            string response = <b><span class='blu'>await </span></b>client.<b>GetStringAsync</b>(url);
            Console.WriteLine("Response: " + response);
        }
        <b>catch</b> (HttpRequestException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
        }
        <b>finally</b>
        {
            client.Dispose();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

    <p>In this example, we create an instance of the <b>HttpClient</b> class and make a <b>GET</b> request to the specified URL address 
      using the <b>GetStringAsync</b> method. The <b>try</b> block is always executed, where we await the response and display it in the 
      console. If an error/exception occurs during the request, the <b>catch</b> block is automatically executed, the error is caught, 
      and a message indicating the type of error is displayed. The <b>finally</b> block is always executed to ensure that the 
      <b>HttpClient</b> is properly released, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.</p>
    <p>Remember to handle exceptions in a way that provides meaningful feedback to the user (displaying an appropriate message 
      for the occurred error) and take appropriate actions (releasing the object that threw the error) based on the specific scenario.</p>
    <p><b>checked</b> and <b>unchecked</b></p>
    <p>In C#, the keywords <b>checked</b> and <b>unchecked</b> are used to control the behavior of integer arithmetic 
      operations (<b>int</b>) regarding overflow checking.</p>
    <p>By default, C# performs arithmetic operations on integers with <b>checked</b> overflow checking. This means that if an arithmetic 
      operation results in overflow (e.g., adding two large positive integers that result in a value above the maximum limit for the data 
      type), it will throw an <b>OverflowException</b>. The <b>checked</b> keyword explicitly enables overflow checking for a block of code, 
      ensuring that all arithmetic operations within that block will throw an exception if overflow occurs:</p>
            
<pre class='pre'>
<b>checked</b>
{
    int x = int.MaxValue; // x ➜ <b>Maximum</b> value for the int type
    int y = 1;
    int result = x + y;  // This code will throw an <b>OverflowException</b> 
                         // because the <b>Maximum</b> value is exceeded by 1
}
</pre>

    <p><b>unchecked</b> allows arithmetic operations to be performed without overflow checking. If an overflow occurs during an 
    operation, the <b>Result</b> starts from the <b>Minimum</b> value for the int type, which can lead to unexpected results.</p>

            
<pre class='pre'>
<b>unchecked</b>
{
    int x = int.MaxValue;
    int y = 1;
    int result = x + y;  // Result is overflowed to the smallest negative number for <b>int</b>
}
</pre>

    
    <p>It is important to note that <b>checked</b> and <b>unchecked</b> blocks primarily affect integer (<b>int</b>) arithmetic 
    operations (<b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>/</b>, <b>%</b>, etc.). They do not affect floating-point arithmetic 
    (<b>float</b>, <b>double</b>) or other data types.</p>

    <p><b>File Reading and Writing</b></p>
    <p>Here's a brief example of how you can write a Unicode/UTF-8 string from a variable to a file and then read it back into another variable:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
using System.Text;

String in different languages <b>UTF-8</b> to be written to a file
string <b><span class='grn'>wStr</span></b> = "Hold my beer, ビールを預けておいてください, Подержи мое пиво!";
Console.WriteLine("Original String: " + <b><span class='grn'>wStr</span></b>); // Display the original string
string <b><span class='blu'>filePath </span></b>= "<span class='blu'>output.txt</span>";
// Writing <b><span class='grn'>wStr </span></b> to a file named <b><span class='blu'>output.txt</span></b>
File.WriteAllText(<b><span class='blu'>filePath</span></b>, <b><span class='grn'>wStr</span></b>);

// Reading <b><span class='ora'>rStr</span></b> from the same file (<b>output.txt</b>)
string <b><span class='ora'>rStr</span></b> = File.ReadAllText(<b><span class='blu'>filePath</span></b>);

Console.WriteLine("Read String: " + <b><span class='ora'>rStr</span></b>); // Displaying the read string

<b>// Result:</b>
// Write String: Hold my beer, ビールを預けておいてください, Подержи мое пиво!
// Read String: Hold my beer, ビールを預けておいてください, Подержи мое пиво!
</pre>


    <p>In this example, we first display the original string on the screen - <b><span class='grn'>wStr</span></b>. Then we use the 
      <b>File.WriteAllText</b> object to write the string from the <b>wStr</b> variable to a file, the name of which is specified in 
      the <b><span class='blu'>filePath</span></b> variable.</p> <p>Then we use the <b>File.ReadAllText</b> object to read the contents 
      of the file back into the <b><span class='ora'>rStr</span></b> variable. Finally, we display the read string - 
      <b><span class='ora'>rStr</span></b>, to check if the data has been written and read correctly.</p>

    <h2 id='VIII'>VIII. Web Applications: Razor × Blazor × SignalR</h2>
    
    <p><b>Brief description of Razor, Blazor, and SignalR</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Razor</b> allows you to create dynamic web pages in ASP.NET. It is a server-side technology developed by Microsoft and is primarily used 
      in combination with ASP.NET Core. Razor provides a clean and efficient way to blend HTML markup with C# code to generate dynamic 
      server-side content and render it in the client's web browser.</p> 
      
    <p><b>Blazor</b> is an innovative web technology, also developed by Microsoft. It enables you to create interactive web applications 
      using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor uses the WebAssembly technology to execute C# code directly in the browser, allowing developers to 
      create rich and interactive client-side applications. With Blazor, you can write your application logic in C# and have it executed
      on the client side while seamlessly interacting with the server-side backend.</p> 
      
    <p><b>SignalR</b> is a real-time web communication framework provided by Microsoft. It simplifies the development of real-time applications
      by enabling bidirectional communication between the server and the client. SignalR employs various techniques such as WebSockets, 
      server-sent events, and long polling to establish a persistent connection between the client and the server. This enables streaming of 
      data in real time, targeted notifications, and collaborative features among clients. SignalR is widely used in applications that 
      require real-time updates, such as chat applications, stock tickers, collaborative document editing tools, and more.</p>
      
    <p>In summary, <b>Razor</b> is a programming model for creating dynamic server-side web pages, <b>Blazor</b> is a web technology that
      allows you to create interactive web applications using the C# language and execute them in the web browser, and <b>SignalR</b>
      is a real-time web communication technology for real-time updates between the server and the client.</p>
      
    <p><b>SignalR</b></p>
    <p><b>SignalR</b> is a real-time web communication technology developed by <b>Microsoft</b> for the .NET platform. It enables 
      bidirectional communication between the server and clients, allowing real-time updates and interactive features in web applications. 
      Here is a brief overview of SignalR:</p> <p>Real-time communication: SignalR simplifies real-time communication between the 
      server and connected clients, enabling immediate data updates, notifications, and live interactions without the need for constant 
      page refreshing.</p> 
    <p>Bidirectional communication: SignalR supports both server-to-client communication (broadcasting) and client-to-server communication. 
      It allows the server to send data or messages to multiple connected clients simultaneously, and clients can also send data or invoke 
      methods on the server.</p> 
      
    <p>Transport and connection management: SignalR automatically selects the best available transport mechanism based on client capabilities 
      and browser support. It supports various transport options such as <b>WebSockets</b>, server-sent events (<b>SSE</b>), <b>AJAX</b>, and 
      more. It also manages connections, transparently handling reconnections and failed connections.</p>

    <p>Scalability and Load Balancing: SignalR supports scalability across multiple physical servers, enabling the handling of a large 
      number of connected clients and load distribution. It provides implementations of the backend/servers that allow communication 
      between individual physical servers and ensures that messages are broadcasted to all connected clients.</p>
    <p><b>Hubs</b> and Persistent Connections: SignalR provides a high-level abstraction called "Hubs" that simplifies the process of 
      managing client-server communication. Hubs allow clients and servers to invoke methods on each other directly. Alternatively, 
      SignalR also supports "persistent connections" at a lower level for more personalized communication requirements.</p>
    <p>Support for Various Platforms: SignalR is not limited to the .NET framework; it provides client libraries for different 
      platforms, including JavaScript, .NET (C#), Java, Python, and more. This enables the development of real-time applications 
      that can seamlessly communicate between different client platforms.</p>
    <p>SignalR is widely adopted for building real-time features in web applications, such as chat applications, collaboration tools, 
      real-time dashboards, gaming applications, and more. It simplifies the complexity of real-time communication and provides a powerful 
      framework for building interactive and responsive web experiences on the .NET platform.</p>
    <p><b>Brief Description of Key Internet Concepts</b></p>
    <p>An HTML file is a text file with the extension ".html" that contains markup instructions using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It 
      is the standard language for creating web pages and defining their structure and content.</p>
    <p>The content of an HTML file typically consists of various elements and tags that define the structure and presentation of the web page. 
      Here are some key components you can find in an HTML file:</p>
    <p>Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE): It specifies the version of HTML used, which helps browsers understand how to interpret and 
      display the page.</p>
    <p>&lt;html&gt;: The main element of an HTML file that contains all other elements of the web page.</p>
    <p>&lt;head&gt;: This section includes metadata for the document, such as the page title, character encoding, CSS stylesheets, 
      JavaScript files, and more.</p>
    <p>&lt;body&gt;: The &lt;body&gt; element contains the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, headings, 
      paragraphs, and other HTML elements.</p>
    <p>Tags</p>
    <p>HTML tags are used to define and structure the content of a web page. Examples include &lt;h1&gt; for headings, &lt;p&gt; for 
      paragraphs, &lt;img&gt; for images, &lt;a&gt; for hyperlinks to other pages, and many more. Tags can also have attributes that 
      provide additional information or modify their behavior.</p>
    <p>Comments: HTML allows you to add comments in the code using &lt;!-- comment --&gt;. These comments are ignored by the browser and 
      are useful for documentation or temporarily disabling parts of the code.</p>
    <p>In general, an HTML file provides a way to structure and present information on the web. It combines textual content, multimedia 
      elements, and formatting instructions to create an interactive web page that can be rendered and displayed by web browsers.</p>
    <p><b>Important Tags</b></p>
    <p>&lt;div&gt;: The &lt;div&gt; tag is a container element used to group other HTML elements together. It is commonly used for 
      styling purposes and helps organize and style different sections of a web page.</p>
    <p>&lt;input type="text"&gt;: The &lt;input&gt; tag with the type="text" attribute creates a text input field in an HTML form. It allows 
      users to enter and edit text.</p> 
    <p>&lt;input type="button"&gt;: The &lt;input&gt; tag with the type="button" attribute creates a button that can be clicked on a web page. 
      It is typically used to trigger a specific action or event when clicked by the user.</p>

    <p>&lt;<b>ul</b>&gt; and &lt;<b>li</b>&gt;: The &lt;ul&gt; (unordered list) and &lt;li&gt; (list item) tags are used together to create 
      a list in HTML. The &lt;ul&gt; tag represents the container for the list, and each individual item is defined using the &lt;li&gt; 
      tag.</p>
    <p>&lt;<b>script</b>&gt;: The &lt;<b>script</b>&gt; tag is used to embed or reference JavaScript code in an HTML document. It allows you 
      to add interactivity, perform calculations, manipulate HTML content, and handle events on a web page using the JavaScript language, 
      which has a syntax similar to C#.</p>
    <p>Additional attributes: For example, the tag &lt;div <b>id</b>='content' <b>class</b>='content'&gt; Hold my beer &lt;/div&gt; has 2 
      attributes: id (a unique identifier for the entire HTML document) and class (CSS style class) responsible for its styling, such as 
      appearance on the screen, color, position, etc. Each tag must have a closing tag, e.g., &lt;/div&gt;.</p>
    <p>Now let's discuss the additional <b>attributes</b> of the mentioned tags:</p>
    <p><b>id</b> of a tag refers to the unique identifier assigned to a specific HTML element using the <b>id</b> attribute. 
      It allows you to manipulate specific elements using JavaScript or CSS. Each identifier must be unique within the HTML document.</p>
    
    <p><b>JavaScript</b> Functions</p>
    <p>The <b>document.getElementById</b> function is a JavaScript method that allows you to select a specific HTML element based on 
      its unique identifier (<b>id</b>). You can use this method to access and modify properties, content, or styles of a specific element on 
      the web page.</p>
    <p><b>document.createElement</b>("li"): This JavaScript code dynamically creates a new &lt;<b>li</b>&gt; element using 
      the <b>createElement</b> method. It allows you to generate HTML elements programmatically, which can be useful for creating dynamic 
      content or manipulating the structure of the web page.</p>
    <p><b>appendChild</b> is a method in JavaScript used to insert a newly created or existing element as a child element of another 
      element. It adds the specified element as the last child element of the target element, effectively appending it to the end of the 
      list of child elements. This method is often used for dynamically adding or moving elements within the structure of an HTML document.</p>

    <p><b>JavaScript</b></p>
    <p>When an HTML file and a JavaScript (JS) file work together on the client side, they can create a lively and real-time web experience. 
      Here's a high-level overview of how they work:</p>
    <p>HTML Structure: The HTML file provides the structure and initial content of the web page. It defines the layout, headings, paragraphs, 
      images, and other elements that form the basis of the user interface.</p>
    <p>Loading JavaScript: Within the HTML file, there is typically a &lt;<b>script</b>&gt; tag that references an external JS file. For 
      example, &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. This tells the browser to load and execute the JS file.</p>
    <p><b>Event Handling</b>: JavaScript allows you to define event handlers that respond to user interactions or specific events on the web 
      page. For example, you can listen for button clicks, form submissions, or mouse movements. When an event occurs, the corresponding JS code is executed.</p>
    <p><b>Modifying HTML</b>: With JavaScript, you can access and modify HTML elements. This is usually done using methods 
      like <b>document.getElementById</b> or <b>document.querySelector</b> to select specific elements. Then, you can dynamically change 
      their content, style, or structure.</p>
    <p><b>AJAX</b> and <b>Fetch</b>: JavaScript provides mechanisms like AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) or <b>Fetch</b> for 
      sending asynchronous requests to the server without reloading the entire web page. This allows you to retrieve data from APIs or 
      send data to the server in the background, enabling real-time updates without interrupting the user's workflow.</p>
    <p><b>DOM (Document Object Model)</b> Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation of the hierarchy of HTML elements 
      as a tree-like structure in memory. JavaScript can interact with this DOM by adding, modifying, or removing elements dynamically. 
      For example, you can create new HTML elements, update their content, or change their visibility based on user actions or received data.</p>

    <p><b>Timers and Animation</b>: JavaScript offers functions like <b>setInterval</b> and <b>requestAnimationFrame</b> that allow you 
      to execute code at specific intervals or synchronize the presented information in the browser. This enables the creation of 
      animations, periodic content updates, or the application of real-time visual effects.</p>

    <p>By combining the HTML structure and the dynamic capabilities of JavaScript, you can create interactive and responsive web 
      experiences. JavaScript enables event handling, manipulation of HTML elements, communication with servers, and the ability to 
      update web pages in real-time, resulting in a lively and engaging user interface.</p>

    <p><b>CSS</b></p>

    <p><b>CSS</b> (<b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>) plays a crucial role in complementing HTML and JavaScript to enhance the presentation and 
      style of web pages. Here's how CSS fits into the picture:</p>

    <p>CSS separates the visual presentation of a web page from its structure and content. By storing the styling instructions in a 
      separate CSS file or within &lt;<b>style</b>&gt; tags, it allows for better organization, maintenance, and reuse of styles across multiple 
      HTML pages.</p>

    <p><b>Styling HTML Elements</b>: CSS allows you to apply styles to HTML elements defined in the HTML file. You can select elements 
      using CSS selectors and define various properties such as colors, fonts, sizes, margins, borders, and more. This allows you to 
      customize the appearance and layout of elements to match your design requirements.</p>

    <p>Responsive Design: CSS provides features like media queries that enable you to create responsive designs. With media queries, you 
      can define different styles for different screen sizes of various devices, such as tablets, phones, and computers. This ensures that 
      your web page adapts and looks good on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.</p>

    <p><b>Positioning</b>: CSS offers various techniques for styling and positioning different elements of a web page. By using properties 
      like <b>display</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>position</b>, and CSS Grid or Flexbox, you can create complex layouts, align elements, and control 
      their positioning within the page.</p>

    <p><b>Bootstrap</b></p>

    <p>The greatest advantage of <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/' target='_blank' class='lnk'>Bootstrap</a> is that it automatically integrates 
      into your projects if they are created with the following command:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
@404joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank/holdmybeer $ <b>dotnet new webapp</b>
</pre>

    <p>In order to use Bootstrap, you need to search for the tag you want to style with CSS and add the corresponding CSS class to it. 
      For example, if you search for the table tag in an internet search engine with the term 'table tag bootstrap class', you can add 
      it to your HTML:</p>
            
<pre class='pre'>
&lt;table <span class='grn'>class='table'</span>&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
           
    <p><b>Bootstrap</b> is a popular CSS library that provides a collection of pre-designed <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> components, 
      along with a responsive system for arranging elements. Some advantages of using Bootstrap include:</p>
    <p>Responsive design: Bootstrap is built with responsive design principles in mind, making it easier to create web pages that 
      automatically adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It provides a responsive grid system and pre-defined CSS classes for 
      responsive behavior.</p>
    <p>Bootstrap offers a wide range of ready-to-use components such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, modals, and more. These components can 
      be easily integrated into your HTML code, enabling quick and efficient creation of professionally styled web pages.</p> 
    <p>Consistent and professional appearance: Bootstrap provides a consistent and visually appealing design language. Its components are 
      styled consistently, providing a cohesive and professional look for your web application.</p> 
    <p>Customization: While Bootstrap provides default styles and components, it also allows for customization. You can easily customize CSS 
      styles to tailor the presentation to your branding and design requirements for your project.</p> 
    <p>Compatibility across different browsers: Bootstrap is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers, ensuring that your web pages 
      look and function consistently across different browsers and platforms.</p> 
    <p>In general, CSS enhances the visual presentation of HTML elements, while libraries like Bootstrap provide pre-designed components and 
      styles that streamline web development and help create responsive and visually appealing web experiences.</p>

    <p><b>Practice</b></p>
        
    
    <p> 1. <b>Razor:</b> Sending information from the web frontend (browser) to the backend (.cs program),
      printing it in the console, and returning it back to the browser. To achieve this, execute the following commands:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
@404joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ mkdir post
@404joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ cd post
@404joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank/post $ dotnet new webapp
</pre>

<p>In index.cshtml, create a POST form that makes a POST request to the backend.</p>

<pre class='pre'>
    &lt;form method="post"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text"  asp-for="Data" name="Data" /&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

<p>In index.cshtml.cs - Handle the POST request:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
    // In the IndexModel class add : 

    [BindProperty]
    public string Data { get; set; } = "";
    
    public IActionResult OnPost(){  
            Console.WriteLine("--- MSG change --- ➜ post data:" + Data);
            return Page(); // Might also 'RedirectToPage("/Privacy");' be used
    }
</pre>

    <p>Result 1:</p>
    <p><img src="img/image008.jpg" class='img' alt='Post Data'></p>


    <p>Result 2:</p>
    <p><img src="img/image010.jpg" class='img' alt='Post Result'></p>

    <hr>
    
    <p> 2. SignalR: We will create an online chat application as demonstrated in this tutorial: 
      <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr" target='_blank' class='lnk'>Asp NetCore SignalR</a>. To do this, execute 
      the following commands in the Terminal:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
@404joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ mkdir chat
@404joe ➜ /workspaces/codespaces-blank $ cd chat

    <p><b>Databases and Database Management Systems (DBMS)</b></p>
    <p><b>Steps in designing a database</b></p>
    <p>Here are the steps in the process of designing a database. Each step is discussed in more detail in the remaining sections of this 
      document.</p>
    <p><b>First step</b>: Define the purpose of your database. This will help you decide which data you want to store and retrieve.</p>
    <p><b>Second step</b>: Define the tables you need. Once you have a clear purpose for your database, you can divide your information 
      into separate <b>objects</b> such as "Employees" or "Orders." Each <b>object</b> will be a table in your database.</p>
    <p><b>Third step</b>: Define the <b>fields</b> /columns/ you need. Decide what information you want to store in each table. Each 
      category of information in a table is called a <b>field</b> and is represented as a column in the table. For example, a field 
      in an "Employees" table could be "Last Name," and another field could be "Employee Hire Date."</p>
    <p><b>Fourth step</b>: Define the <b>relationships</b> between the individual objects. Examine each table and determine how the data in 
      one table is related to the data in other tables. Add fields to the tables or create new tables to clarify the relationships, if 
      necessary.</p>
    <p><b>Fifth step</b>: Refine your design. Analyze your design for errors. Create the tables and add some sample data. See if you can 
      obtain the desired results from your tables. Make adjustments to the design if necessary.</p>
    <p><b>Basics of database normalization</b></p>
    <p>This article explains the terminology of database normalization for beginners. Understanding this terminology is helpful when 
      discussing the design of a relational database.</p>
    <p><b>Description of normalization</b></p>
    <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This involves creating tables and establishing relationships 
      between those tables according to rules designed to protect the data as well as to create a more flexible database by eliminating 
      redundancy and inconsistent dependencies between the data.</p>
    <p>Redundant data takes up unnecessary disk space and creates maintenance problems. If data that exists in more than one place must 
      be changed, the data must be changed in exactly the same way in all places where it exists. Changing the address of a customer is 
      much easier to perform if that data is stored only in the "Customers" table and nowhere else in the database.</p>
    <p>What is an "inconsistent dependency"? While it may be intuitive for a user to look in the "Customers" table for the address of 
      a specific customer, it may not make sense to look there for the salary of the employee who called that customer. The employee's 
      salary is related to /or depends on/ the employee and should therefore be moved to the "Employees" table. Inconsistent 
      dependencies can hinder data access because the path to find the data may be missing or broken.</p>
    <p>There are several rules for normalizing a database. Each rule is called a "normal form." If the first rule is followed, the 
      database is said to be in "first normal form." If the first three rules are followed, the database is considered to be in 
      "third normal form." Although other levels of normalization are possible, the third normal form is considered the highest 
      level necessary for most applications.</p>
    <p>Like many official rules and specifications, real-world scenarios do not always allow for perfect compliance. In general, 
      normalization requires additional tables, and some developers find this cumbersome. If you decide to violate one of the 
      first three normalization rules, make sure your application anticipates all the problems that may arise, such as duplicate 
      data and inconsistent dependencies.</p>
    <p><b>First Normal Form</b></p>
    <p>• Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.</p>
    <p>• Create a separate table for each set of related data.</p>
    <p>• Identify each set of related data with a primary key.</p>
    <p>Do not use multiple fields in one table to store similar data. For example, to track an item from inventory that can come 
      from two possible sources, the inventory record may have fields for "Supplier Code 1" and "Supplier Code 2".</p>
    <p>What happens when you add a third supplier? Adding a field is not the answer; it requires modifications to the program and the 
      table and does not handle a dynamic number of suppliers smoothly. Instead, place all supplier information in a separate table called 
      Suppliers, and then link the inventory to the suppliers using an item number key or the suppliers to the inventory using a supplier 
      code key.</p>
    <p><b>Second Normal Form</b></p>
    <p>• Create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records.</p>
    <p>• Connect these tables with a foreign key.</p>
    <p>Records should not depend on anything other than the primary key of the table (a composite key if necessary). For example, consider 
      the address of a customer in an accounting system. The address is needed for the Customers table, but also for the Orders, Delivery, 
      Invoices, Receivables, and Collections tables. Instead of storing the customer's address as a separate record in each of these tables, 
      store it in one place, either in the Customers table or in a separate Addresses table.</p>
    <p><b>Third Normal Form</b></p>
    <p>• Eliminate fields that do not depend on the key.</p>
    <p>Values in a record that are not part of the key for that record do not belong in the table. In general, whenever the contents of 
      a group of fields can apply to more than one record in the table, consider putting those fields in a separate table.</p>
    <p>For example, in a table for employee recruitment, the candidate's name and university address may be included. But you need a 
      complete list of universities for mass mailings. If the university information is stored in the candidate table, there is no way to 
      list universities without existing candidates. Create a separate table for universities and link it to the candidate table using the 
      university code key.</p>
    <p><b>EXCEPTION OF THE RULE</b>: Adhering to the third normal form, although theoretically desirable, is not always practical. 
      If you have a Customers table and want to eliminate all possible dependencies between fields, you would need to create separate tables 
      for cities, zip codes, sales representatives, customer classes, and any other factor that may be duplicated in multiple records. In 
      theory, such normalization is worth pursuing. However, many small tables can degrade performance or exceed the capacity of the open 
      file and memory.</p>
    <p>It may be more feasible to apply the third normal form only to data that changes frequently. If some dependent fields remain, 
      design your application to require the user to verify all related fields when any of them is changed.</p>
      
    <p><b>Other Normal Forms</b></p>
    
    <p>The fourth normal form, also known as Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), and the fifth normal form exist but are rarely
      considered in practical design. Ignoring these rules may result in a database design that is less than perfect,
      but it should not affect functionality.</p>
    <p><b>Normalization of an Example Table</b></p>
    <p>These steps demonstrate the process of normalizing a fictitious student table.</p>
    <p>0. <b>Unnormalized table</b>:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Student#</th><th>Advisor</th><th>Adv-Room</th><th><span class='red'>Class1</span></th><th><span class='red'>Class2</span></th><th><span class='red'>Class3</span></th></tr>
      </thead>  
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td>101-07</td><td>143-01</td><td>159-02</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>Smith</td><td>216</td><td>101-07</td><td>143-01</td><td>179-04</td></tr>
      </tbody>  
    </table>
    
    <p>1. <b>First normal form</b>: Without repeating groups /Columns that contain the same information, i.e., no repetitions
      horizontally/</p>
    <p>The tables should have only two dimensions. Since a student participates in multiple classes, those classes should
      be listed in a separate table. The fields <b>Class1</b>, <b>Class2</b>, and <b>Class3</b> in the above records
      indicate a design problem.</p>
    <p>Electronic spreadsheets (like Excel) often use a third dimension, but database tables should not. Another way to
      approach this problem is with a "one-to-many" relationship, not putting the side of "one" and the side of "many"
      in the same table. Instead, create another table in the first normal form by eliminating the repeating group
      (<b>Class#</b>), as shown below:</p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>  
        <tr>
            <th>Student#</th><th>Advisor</th><th>Adv-Room</th><th>Class#</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>  
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td><b><span class='red'>101-07</span></b></td></tr>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td><b><span class='lil'>143-01</span></b></td></tr>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td>159-02</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>Smith</td><td>216</td><td><b><span class='red'>101-07</span></b></td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>Smith</td><td>216</td><td><b><span class='lil'>143-01</span></b></td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>Smith</td><td>216</td><td>179-04</td></tr>
      </tbody>  
    </table>

    <p><b>2. Second normal form</b>: Eliminate redundant data /No repetitions vertically, i.e., no two identical records
      in a given column/</p>
    <p>Pay attention to the set of values in <b>Class#</b> for each value of <b>Student#</b> in the above table. <b>Class#</b>  is not functionally dependent on <b>Student#</b> (the primary key), so this relationship is not in the second
      normal form.</p>
    <p>The following tables demonstrate the second normal form:</p>
    <p><b>Students Table</b>:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Student#</th><th>Advisor</th><th>Adv-Room</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>  
        <tr><td>1022</td><td><b><span class='lil'>Jones</span></b></td><td><b><span class='lil'>412</span></b></td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td><b><span class='ora'>Smith</span></b></td><td><b><span class='ora'>216</span></b></td></tr>
      </tbody>  
    </table>
    
    <p><b>Registrations Table /Many-to-Many Relationship/</b></p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Student#</th><th>Class#</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>  
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>101-07</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>143-01</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>159-02</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>101-07</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>143-01</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>179-04</td></tr>
      </tbody>  
    </table>
    
    <p><b>3. Third normal form</b>: Eliminate data that does not depend on the key</p>
    <p>In the above example, <b>Adv-Room</b> (the advisor's office number) is functionally dependent on the attribute
      <b>Advisor</b>. The solution is to move this attribute from the <b>Students</b> table to the <b>Faculty</b> table,
      as shown below:</p>
    <p><b>Students Table</b></p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Student#</th><th>Advisor</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>  
            <tr><td>1022</td><td>Jones</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4123</td><td>Smith</td></tr>
          </tbody>  
        </table>
        
        <p><b>Registration Table</b></p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Student#</th><th>Class#</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>  
            <tr><td>1022</td><td>101-07</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1022</td><td>143-01</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1022</td><td>159-02</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4123</td><td>101-07</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4123</td><td>143-01</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4123</td><td>179-04</td></tr>
          </tbody>  
        </table>
        
        <p><b>Faculties Table</b></p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Name</th><th>Room</th><th>Dept</th></tr>
          </thead>  
          <tbody>

    <p><b>SQL Basics</b></p>
    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing data stored in a relational database
      management system (RDBMS) or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).</p>
    <p><b>Data Types</b></p>
    <p>Each column in an SQL table has a data type that specifies the kind of data that the column can hold. ANSI SQL
      includes the following data types.</p>
    <p>• String - VARCHAR(<b>n</b>): variable-width string with a maximum size of <b>n</b> characters; for example, "This
      is a string," "Hold my beer," and others;</p>
    <p>• <b>Numbers</b>: <b>INTEGER</b> - integer /25, 320, -3117, .../ or <b>DOUBLE PRECISION</b> - floating-point number
      /3.14, 2.73, -1348.6755, ... / </p>
    <p>• Date and Time: <b>TIMESTAMP</b> - for example, '5-25-2023', '14-01-2014', ...</p>
    <p><b>Creating Tables</b></p>
    <p><b>Data Definition</b> The Data Definition Language (DDL) manages the structure of tables and indexes. The primary
      DDL commands are <b>CREATE</b>, <b>ALTER</b>, and <b>DROP</b>:</p>
    <p><b>CREATE</b> creates an object (e.g., a table) in the database, for example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
CREATE TABLE Faculty(
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Room INTEGER,
    Dept INTEGER
);
</pre>

    <p><b>ALTER</b> modifies the structure of an existing object in various ways, such as adding a column to an existing
      table, for example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
ALTER TABLE Faculty ADD AdvRoom INTEGER;
</pre>

    <p><b>DROP</b> deletes an object from the database, usually irreversibly, i.e., it cannot be recovered, for example:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
DROP TABLE Faculty;
</pre>


    <p><b>Inserting Data into Tables - Data Manipulation Language</b></p>
    <p><b>Data Manipulation</b></p>
    <p>The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL used for adding, updating, and deleting data:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
INSERT INTO Faculty (Advisor, AdvRoom, Dept)
VALUES ('Jones', 412, 42);
</pre>

    <p>Inserts a new record (row) into the <b>Faculties</b> table.</p>
    <p><b>Updating Tables</b></p>
    <p>The UPDATE statement modifies a set of existing rows in a table, for example:</p>        

<pre class='pre'>
UPDATE Faculty SET Advisor='James Jones' WHERE AdvRoom=412;
</pre>

    <p>Updates the Faculty table by setting the value of the cells in the Advisor column to "James Jones" for all rows
      that have the value <b>412</b> in the AdvRoom column.</p>
    <p><b>Retrieving Data from Database Tables</b></p>
    <p><b>Queries</b></p>
    <p>The most common operation in SQL is a <b>query</b>, which is executed with the declarative operator <b>SELECT</b>.
      <b>SELECT</b> retrieves data from one or more tables or expressions. Standard <b>SELECT</b> statements have no
      permanent effect on the database.</p>

    <p>Queries allow the user to describe the desired data, leaving the database management system (DBMS) responsible for planning,
      optimizing, and executing the physical operations required to obtain the specified Result.</p>
    <p>The query includes a list of columns to include in the final Result immediately following the <b>SELECT</b> keyword. An asterisk
      ("<b>*</b>") can also be used to indicate that the query should return all columns from the requested tables. SELECT is
      the most complex expression in SQL, with optional keywords and clauses that include:</p>
    <p>• The <b>FROM</b> clause, which specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data. The FROM clause may include optional
      <b>JOIN</b> subclauses to specify table joining rules.</p>
    <p>• The <b>WHERE</b> clause includes a comparison <b>predicate</b> clause that limits the rows returned by the query. The WHERE
      clause eliminates any rows from the result set where the comparison predicate evaluates to <b>False</b>.</p>
    <p>• The <b>GROUP BY</b> clause is used to group rows with common values into a smaller set of rows. GROUP BY is often used
      in conjunction with SQL aggregate functions (<b>SUM</b> - sum; <b>AVERAGE</b> - average) or to eliminate duplicate rows
      from a result set. The WHERE clause is applied before the GROUP BY clause.</p>
    <p>• The <b>HAVING</b> clause includes a predicate used to filter rows when the <b>GROUP BY</b> clause is used. Since it operates
      on the results of the GROUP BY clause, aggregate functions can be used in the predicate of the HAVING clause (e.g., SELECT
      ... HAVING SUM(PRICE) &gt; 20).</p>
    <p>• The <b>ORDER BY</b> clause identifies which columns to use for sorting the retrieved data and in what direction to sort
      them (ascending - <b>ASC</b> or descending - <b>DESC</b>). Without the ORDER BY clause, the order of rows returned by an
      SQL query is undefined.</p>
    <p>The following is an example of a SELECT query that returns a list of teachers in department 42 from the "Faculties" table.
      The query retrieves all rows from the "Faculty" table where the "Dept" column contains a value equal to 42. The result
      is sorted in ascending order by the "Advisor" name. The asterisk (<b>*</b>) in the selection list indicates that all columns
      from the faculty table should be included in the result set.</p>

<pre class='pre'>
SELECT   * 
FROM     Faculty 
WHERE    Dept = 42 
ORDER BY Advisor
</pre>

    <p>The result of the query is the following table:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Advisor</th><th>AdvRoom</th><th>Dept</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>  
        <tr><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td>42</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Smith</td><td>216</td><td>42</td></tr>
      </tbody>  
    </table>
        
    <p><b>WHERE Predicates: in; between; like; null; exists</b></p>

    <p>These predicates are primarily used in the <b>WHERE</b> clause and include:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
      </thead>

    <p><b>Note about LIKE:</b> LIKE can be used with <b>%</b> or <b>*</b>.</p>
    <p>• * means that results with any single character in place of the * will be retrieved (e.g., SELECT ... LIKE "Joh<b>*</b>"
      ➜ returns records containing "Joh<b>n"</b>, but not "Joh<b>anson"</b> or "<b>Joh</b>").</p>
    <p>• % - results with any set of multiple characters in place of the % will be retrieved (e.g., SELECT ... LIKE "Joh%"
      ➜ returns records containing both "Joh<b>n"</b> and "Joh<b>anson"</b> and "Joh").</p>

 
    <p><b>The OR and AND clauses</b> are logical operators in SQL that allow you to combine multiple conditions. They are typically used in 
      the WHERE clause to specify that a row should be included in the result set if at least one of the WHERE conditions evaluates to true.</p>
          
<pre class='pre'>
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR/AND condition2;
</pre>

    <p>Please note that the OR/AND clause can be used in various SQL clauses such as WHERE, HAVING, JOIN, LIKE, CASE, EXISTS, 
      and in combination with the UNION and UNION ALL operators to combine query results.</p>

    <p><b>COALESCE</b> When using LIKE, you can also use collations that allow for case-insensitive string comparisons, such as 
      matching "John" with "john". They can be implemented using the COALESCE clause or in another way depending on the specific DBMS.</p>

    <p><b>Joins</b></p>
    <p>The example below demonstrates a query that joins multiple tables based on a relationship using the JOIN clause, returning a 
      list of all registrations and information about the associated advisors for each record.</p>


<pre class='pre'>
SELECT   Registration.Student, Registration.Class,
         Students.Advisor,
         Faculty.AdvRoom, Faculty.Dept
FROM     Registration
JOIN     Students on Registration.Student = Students.Student
JOIN     Facuty on Facuty.Advisor = Students.Advisor
ORDER BY Registration.Student
</pre>

    <p>The resulting output may look like the following:</p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th><b>Student</b></th><th><b>Class</b></th><th><b>Advisor</b></th><th><b>AdvRoom</b></th><th><b>Dept</b></th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>101-07</td><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td>42</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>143-01</td><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td>42</td></tr>
        <tr><td>1022</td><td>159-02</td><td>Jones</td><td>412</td><td>42</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4123</td><td>201-01</td><td>Smith</td><td>216</td><td>42</td></tr>

    </table>
        
    <p>SQL has several types of joins that allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns (relationships).
      Here's a brief explanation of the main types of joins:</p>
    
    <p><b>• INNER JOIN:</b> The inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. It combines
      a row from one table with a row from the other into a new row in the result based on the specified join condition.
      If the query only specifies JOIN, it is an inner join by default.</p>
    
    <p><b>• LEFT JOIN:</b> The left join returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
      If there are no matches, it still returns all rows from the left table and replaces the missing values with NULL.</p>
    
    <p><b>• RIGHT JOIN:</b> The right join is similar to the left join but returns all rows from the right table and the
      matching rows from the left table. If there are no matches, it still returns all rows from the right table and
      replaces the missing values with NULL.</p>
    
    <p><b>• FULL JOIN:</b> The full join, also known as a full outer join, returns all rows from both the left and right
      tables. If there are matching rows, it combines them into a single row. If there are no matches, it includes
      NULL values for the columns from the non-matching table.</p>
    
    <p><b>• CROSS JOIN:</b> The cross join, also known as a Cartesian join, returns the Cartesian product of the two tables,
      which means all possible combinations of rows from both tables.</p>
    
    <p>These are the main types of joins in SQL that allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on different
      conditions.</p>
    
    <p><b>Functions</b></p>
    
    <p>SQL is designed for a specific purpose: querying data stored in a relational database. SQL is based on a declarative,
      set-based query language, rather than an imperative language like C or BASIC. However, extensions to the standard
      SQL add functionality that can include user-defined functions (Stored Procedures) or data views (View).</p>

    <p><b>WEBAPP × RAZOR PAGES /SSR/</b></p>        

    <p>The idea of the following exercise is to execute a SQL SELECT query against the database, retrieve a table from
      it, and generate HTML table code /HTML tags/ from it, which will be returned to the visitor as ready-made HTML
      /prepared on the server and returned to the client/. This is known as <b>SSR</b> - Server-Side Rendering. To
      achieve this, in <b>Pages/index.cshtml.cs</b>, you need to add the following: 1. A query to the database that
      returns a Result; 2. Populate two arrays - Cols - for column names (one-dimensional), and Rows - for the content
      of the table (two-dimensional), both of type string. After that, you can use Cols and Rows in the HTML template
      of the page during its rendering/generation on the web server. If a GET request is made from the web browser
      to a certain address, for example, https://www.somehost.com/, the web server on this host, by default, returns
      the file index.html. However, if the request is for https://www.somehost.com/Privacy.html, the web server returns
      the file Privacy.html.</p>

    <p><img src="img/image006.jpg" class='img' alt='Browse Result'></p>
    
    <p>Anyway, the above example became quite long, but we can make it even more complex. In the file <b>/sql_webapp/Pages/index.cshtml</b>,
      modify the table tag: &lt;table&gt;, by adding a Bootstrap CSS class to the table in the following way:</p>
   
<pre class='pre'>
&lt;table <span class='yel'>class='table'</span>&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Result:</p>
      <p><img src='img/image014.jpg' class='img' alt='Bootstrap CSS'></p>    

    <p>The advantages of Bootstrap are that you can readily use CSS styles by searching for the tag to which you want
      to apply a CSS style in the Bootstrap website and add the class to the corresponding tag. However, a disadvantage
      is that some small aspects of a CSS library are difficult to modify.</p>

    <p><b>WEBAPP × JSON × VUE.JS</b></p>
    <p>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) /above/ and AJAX with JSON and Vue.js /CSR/ are two different approaches for building
      web applications.</p>
    <p><b>Server-Side Rendering (SSR):</b></p>
    <p>SSR is slower for subsequent interaction after the initial loading because it requires a round trip to the server,
      and large HTML documents are generated for each action.</p>
    
    <p><b>AJAX + JSON + Vue.js /CSR/</b></p>
    <p><b>CSR</b> /Client Side Rendering/ loads the initial HTML template and JavaScript from the server to the browser
      and then uses <b>AJAX</b> (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests to fetch <b>JSON</b> data from the server
      (through a <b>JSON api Endpoint</b>). Then, in the browser, it generates HTML content and renders it.</p>
    <p><b>JSON</b> data is used to dynamically update the user interface.</p>
    <p><b>Vue.js</b> is a popular JavaScript platform that provides powerful data binding and templating and is based
      on reusable components.</p>
    <p><b>AJAX</b> requests allow the application to asynchronously fetch data from the server without reloading the entire
      page.</p>
    <p>The main advantage of this approach /CSR/ is a more interactive and responsive user experience, as the application
      can update specific parts of the page without fully reloading it.</p>
    <p>Scalability: By offloading data processing to the client, CSR can reduce server load and improve application scalability.</p>
    <p>Separation of concerns: With CSR, you can separate the logic for fetching and rendering data, which allows for
      cleaner code organization and maintenance.</p>
    <p><b>Api Endpoint</b> - An endpoint for an AJAX request that returns a JSON string generated on the server, as follows:</p>

<pre class='pre'>
[{"StudentID":1022,"ClassID":"101-07","Advisor":"Jones","Room":412,"Dept":42},

 {"StudentID":4123,"ClassID":"179-04","Advisor":"Smith","Room":216,"Dept":42}]
</pre>
        
    <p>First, create a new application:</p>

</pre>

    <p>In Program.cs, add mappings for JSON endpoints /static file https://somehost.com/index.html and API endpoint 
      <span class='ora'>https://somehost.com/api/MyJSON</span> /:</p>

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRouting();

// Map JSON api
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllers();
});

// Map  index.html 
app.UseDefaultFiles();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.SendFileAsync("index.html");
});

app.Run();
</pre> 

    <p>An API endpoint, accessible later at the address: https://someserver.com<b><span class='ora'>/api/MyJSON</span></b>, write the following
